  Abstract                 = {Identifying the spatial distribution of genetic variation across the landscape is an essential step in informing species conservation. Comparison of closely related and geographically overlapping species can be particularly useful in cases where landscape may similarly influence genetic structure. Congruent patterns among species highlight the importance that landscape heterogeneity plays in determining genetic structure whereas contrasting patterns emphasize differences in species-specific ecology and life-history or the importance of species-specific adaptation to local environments. We examined the interacting roles of demography and adaptation in determining spatial genetic structure in two closely related and geographically overlapping species in a pristine environment. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci exhibiting both neutral and putative adaptive variation, we evaluated the genetic structure of sockeye salmon in the Copper River, Alaska; these data were compared to existing data for Chinook salmon from the same region. Overall, both species exhibited patterns of isolation by distance; the spatial distribution of populations largely determined the distribution of genetic variation across the landscape. Further, both species exhibited largely congruent patterns of within- and among-population genetic diversity, highlighting the role that landscape heterogeneity and historical processes play in determining spatial genetic structure. Potential adaptive differences among geographically proximate sockeye salmon populations were observed when high FST outlier SNPs were evaluated in a landscape genetics context. Results were evaluated in the context of conservation efforts with an emphasis on reproductive isolation, historical processes, and local adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Population viability analysis (PVA) models incorporate spatial dynamics in different ways. At one extreme are the occupancy models that are based on the number of occupied populations. The simplest occupancy models ignore the location of populations. At the other extreme are individual-based models, which describe the spatial structure with the location of each individual in the population, or the location of territories or home ranges. In between these are spatially structured metapopulation models that describe the dynamics of each population with structured demographic models and incorporate spatial dynamics by modeling dispersal and temporal correlation among populations. Both dispersal and correlation between each pair of populations depend on the location of the populations, making these models spatially structured. In this article, I describe a method that expands spatially structured metapopulation models by incorporating information about habitat relationships of the species and the characteristics of the landscape in which the metapopulation exists. This method uses a habitat suitability map to determine the spatial structure of the metapopulation, including the number, size, and location of habitat patches in which subpopulations of the metapopulation live. The habitat suitability map can be calculated in a number of different ways, including statistical analyses (such as logistic regression) that find the relationship between the occurrence (or, density) of the species and independent variables which describe its habitat requirements. The habitat suitability map is then used to calculate the spatial structure of the metapopulation, based on species-specific characteristics such as the home range size, dispersal distance, and minimum habitat suitability for reproduction.},

These rules have received international acceptance and have become one of the most important decision tools in conservation biology because of their wide applicability, objectivity, and simplicity of use. The input data for these rules are often estimated with considerable uncertainty due to measurement error, natural variation, and vagueness in definitions of parameters used in the rules. Currently, no specific guidelines exist for dealing with uncertainty. Interpretation of uncertain data by different assessors may lead to inconsistent classifications because attitudes toward uncertainty and risk may have an important influence on the classification of threatened species. We propose a method of dealing with uncertainty that can be applied to the current IUCN criteria without altering the rules, thresholds, or intent of these criteria. Our method propagates the uncertainty in the input parameters and assigns the evaluated species either to a single category (as the current criteria do) or to a range of plausible categories, depending on the nature and extent of uncertainties.},

Compared to other alternatives for making conservation decisions, PVA provides a rigorous methodology that can use different types of data, a way to incorporate uncertainties and natural variabilities, and products or predictions that are relevant to conservation goals. The disadvantages of PVA include its single-species focus and requirements for data that may not be available for many species. PVAs are most useful when they address a specific question involving a focal (e.g., threatened, indicator, sensitive, or umbrella) species, when their level of detail is consistent with the available data, and when they focus on relative (i.e., comparative) rather than absolute results, and risks of decline rather than extinction. This overview provides guidelines for choosing a PVA model among three categories, from data-intensive individual-based population models to simple occupancy metapopulation models.},

  abstract  = {1 In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence-absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 

2 In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 

3 The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 

4 When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 

5 Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presenceâ€“absence maps.},

  abstract  = {Estimates of occurrence rates for offshore oil spills are useful for analyzing potential oil-spill impacts and for oil-spill response contingency planning. With the implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (U.S. Public Law 101-380, August 18, 1990), estimates of oil-spill occurrence became even more important to natural resource trustees and to responsible parties involved in oil and gas activities.
Oil-spill occurrence rate estimates have been revised based on U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (U.S. OCS) platform and pipeline spill data (1964 through 1999), worldwide tanker spill data (1974 through 1999), and barge spill data for U.S. waters (1974-1999). These spill rates are expressed and normalized in terms of number of spills per volume of crude oil handled. All estimates of spill occurrence rates were restricted to spills greater than or equal to 1,000 barrels (159 m3, 159 kiloliters, 136 metric tonnes, 42,000 U.S. gallons). 
The revisions compared to the previously published rates calculated through 1992 (Anderson & LaBelle, 1994) indicate that estimates for the U.S. OCS platform spill occurrence rates continue to decline, primarily because no spills have occurred since 1980. The U.S. OCS pipeline spill occurrence rates for spills greater than or equal to 1,000 barrels remained essentially unchanged. However, the rate for larger OCS pipeline spills (greater than or equal to 10,000 barrels) has decreased significantly. Worldwide tanker spill rates, rates for tanker spills in U.S. waters, and rates for barge spills in U.S. waters decreased significantly. The most recent 15-year estimates for 1985-1999 (compared to rates for the entire data series) showed that rates for U.S. OCS platforms, tankers, and barges continued to decline.},

  Abstract                 = {The Minerals Management Service estimates the likelihood of oil spills of 1000 barrels and greater occurring in association with the production and transportation of offshore oil on the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The estimation process uses a spill rate constant, based on historical accidents, expressed in terms of number of spills per 109 barrels of oil produced or transported. The mean spill occurrence estimate is obtained by multiplying the rate constant by the volume of oil projected to be handled. The probability of one or more spills occurring in a given production period is then estimated by using the mean number of spills in a Poisson process. The calculated occurrence rates of 0·60 spills per 109 barrels produced on US OCS platforms and 0·67 spills per 109 barrels transported in US OCS pipelines represent a decline of 40 and 58%, respectively, since last evaluated in 1983. Spill occurrence rates for worldwide tanker transport remained unchanged, since last evaluated in 1983, at 0·90 for [`]at-sea' spills and 0·40 for [`]in-port' spills.},

  abstract  = {Acoustic remote sensing of the seabed using single-beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and sidescan sonars combined and individually are providing technological solutions to marine-habitat mapping initiatives. We believe the science of acoustic seabed classification (ASC) is at its nascence. A comprehensive review of ASC science was undertaken by an international group of scientists under the auspices of ICES. The review was prompted by the growing need to classify and map marine ecosystems across a range of spatial scales in support of ecosystem-based science for ocean management. A review of the theory of sound-scattering from seabeds emphasizes the variety of theoretical models currently in use and the ongoing evolution of our understanding. Acoustic-signal conditioning and data quality assurance before classification using objective, repeatable procedures are important technical considerations where standardization of methods is only just beginning. The issue of temporal and spatial scales is reviewed, with emphasis on matching observational scales to those of the natural world. It is emphasized throughout that the seabed is not static but changes over multiple time-scales as a consequence of natural physical and biological processes. A summary of existing commercial ASC systems provides an introduction to existing capabilities. Verification (ground-truthing) methods are reviewed, emphasizing the difficulties of matching observational scales with acoustic-backscatter data. Survey designs for ASC explore methods that extend beyond traditional oceanographic and fisheries survey techniques. Finally, future directions for acoustic seabed classification science were identified in the key areas requiring immediate attention by the international scientific community.},

Ecosystem-based management approaches have emerged using marine protected areas (MPA) as the main tool. Several classifications of marine protected areas benefits have been made, but all have focused only on the benefits to humans, neglecting many important benefits accrued to nature. This paper presents a new comprehensive classification of MPA benefits that will provide scientists and managers with an inclusive framework to accurately identify and account for all possible benefits derived from MPAs. The paper also analyses the methods available for valuing these benefits. A total of 99 benefits were identified within nine main categories: fishery, non-fishery, management, education/research, cultural, process, ecosystem, population and species benefits. These categories are arranged in two main divisions (direct and indirect benefits), which, at the same time, fall within the realms of benefits to humans and to nature.},

To determine and evaluate practical approaches to predict fine sediments (<2Â mm diameter) that could support Tubifex spp. aggregations, we measured habitat features in a catchment with field measures and metrics derived from digital data sets and geospatial tools at three different spatial extents (m2) within a hierarchical structure. 3. We used linear mixed models to test plausible candidate models that best explained the presence of fine sediments measured in stream surveys with metrics from several spatial extents. 4. The percent slow water habitat measured at the finest extent provided the best model to predict the likely presence of fine sediments. The most influential models to predict fine sediments using landscape metrics measured at broader extents included variables that measure the percentage land cover in conifer or agriculture, specifically, decreases in conifer cover and increases in agriculture. 5. The overall best-fitting model of the presence of fine sediments in a stream reach combined variables measured and operating at different spatial extents. 6. Landscape features modelled within a hierarchical framework may be useful tools to evaluate and prioritise areas with fine sediments that may be at risk of infection by Myxobolus cerebralis.},

  Abstract                 = {Considering the long history of oil extraction and the numerous platforms that exist in the southern Gulf of Mexico, a regional approach has been used to investigate the impact of oilrelated activities on the macrobenthic community. The objective was to determine the effect of oilrelated activity in a region known to have a highly variable benthic community composition due to temporal and spatial variability of its natural environment. A transect design along gradients of natural variables and disturbance intensities, including active oil platforms, was implemented during the rainy and winter storms (‘northers’) seasons of 1999 to 2000. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to a data set of 2 macroinfauna size fractions retained on 0.5 and 2 mm sieves, in conjunction with levels of metals, oil hydrocarbons and a range of natural sediment variables. A pattern of contamination existed, with increased levels of contaminants at stations close to rigs and in areas of high oil platform densities. At these sites, macroinfauna abundance and biomass were reduced. Regression analyses and matching of Biotic to Environmental multivariate patterns (BIO–ENV) indicated that a combination of metals and natural sediment variables best explained the variability in macroinfauna data for all sites. Meta-analysis at phylum level was employed to specifically assess disturbance. The results of this technique were inconsistent between sampling dates due to a complex influence of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. However, increased variability in community composition was linked to oil-related disturbance.},

  Abstract                 = {Loss of connectivity is one of the main causes of decreases in habitat availability and, thus, in species abundance and occurrence in fragmented landscapes. It is therefore important to measure habitat connectivity for conservation purposes, but there are several difficulties in quantifying connectivity, including the need for species movement behavioral data and the existence of few consistent indices to describe such data. In the present study, we used a graph theoretical framework to measure habitat availability, and we evaluate whether this variable is adequate to explain the occurrence pattern of an Atlantic rainforest bird ( Pyriglena leucoptera , Thamnophilidae). The playback technique was used to parameterize the connectivity component of habitat availability indices and to determine the presence or absence of the study species in forest patches. Patch- and landscape-level habitat availability indices were considered as explanatory variables. Two of these were landscape-level indices, which varied in terms of how inter-patch connections are defined, using either a binary or probabilistic approach. This study produced four striking results. First, even short open gaps may disrupt habitat continuity for P. leucoptera . Second, the occurrence of P. leucoptera was positively affected by habitat availability. Third, proper measures of this explanatory variable should account for the landscape context around the focal patch, emphasizing the importance of habitat connectivity. Finally, habitat availability indices should consider probabilistic and not binary inter-patch connections when intending to explain the occurrence of bird species in fragmented landscapes. We discuss some conservation implications of our results, stressing the advantages of an ecologically scaled graph theoretical framework.},

  abstract  = {We examined the invertebrate assemblages associated with macroalgal canopies in the Mingan Islands (northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada) in the summer and fall of 2001. Invertebrates were sampled in patches or beds of 4 species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Agarum cribrosum, Desmarestia viridis and Ptilota serrata) as well as in adjacent urchin barrens. Multivariate analyses of the invertebrates on the algal fronds, those on the underlying substratum, and the 2 groups together demonstrated differences in invertebrate assemblages among all 5 habitats. A. esculenta sheltered the most distinct invertebrate community due to the domination of the substratum under this alga by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Differences among other canopy types were due to differences in invertebrate assemblages both on the algal fronds and on the substratum. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of the canopy of the 2 most abundant macroalgae, A. esculenta and A. cribrosum, was carried out to examine their effects on mussels. Recruitment of mussels onto ceramic tiles varied among treatments and was greatest in the A. esculenta zone with greater, but non-significant, recruitment under the canopy. The growth of mussels from early July to October was higher in the A. cribrosum zone than the A. esculenta zone. However, there was no effect of the algal canopy in either zone. Our study demonstrates that the local diversity and distribution of benthic invertebrates is intimately associated with macroalgae, and reinforces the need for detailed sampling and analyses for assessing distributional patterns.},

  abstract  = {Distribution models are used to predict the likelihood of occurrence or abundance of a species at locations where census data are not available. An integral part of modelling is the testing of model performance. We compared different schemes and measures for testing model performance using 79 species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The four testing schemes we compared featured increasing independence between test and training data: resubstitution, random data hold-out and two spatially segregated data hold-out designs. The different testing measures also addressed different levels of information content in the dependent variable: regression R2 for absolute abundance, squared correlation coefficient r2 for relative abundance and AUC/Somer's D for presence/absence. We found that higher levels of independence between test and training data lead to lower assessments of prediction accuracy. Even for data collected independently, spatial autocorrelation leads to dependence between random hold-out test data and training data, and thus to inflated measures of model performance. While there is a general awareness of the importance of autocorrelation to model building and hypothesis testing, its consequences via violation of independence between training and testing data have not been addressed systematically and comprehensively before. Furthermore, increasing information content (from correctly classifying presence/absence, to predicting relative abundance, to predicting absolute abundance) leads to decreasing predictive performance. The current tests for presence/absence distribution models are typically overly optimistic because a) the test and training data are not independent and b) the correct classification of presence/absence has a relatively low information content and thus capability to address ecological and conservation questions compared to a prediction of abundance. Meaningful evaluation of model performance requires testing on spatially independent data, if the intended application of the model is to predict into new geographic or climatic space, which arguably is the case for most applications of distribution models.},

  abstract  = {Characterizing spatial structure and delineating meaningful spatial boundaries have useful applications to understanding regional dynamics in marine systems, and are integral to ecosystem approaches to fisheries management. Physical structure and drivers combine with biological responses and interactions to organize marine systems in unique ways at multiple scales. We apply multivariate statistical methods to define spatially coherent ecological units or ecoregions in the eastern Bering Sea. We also illustrate a practical approach to integrate data on species distribution, habitat structure and physical forcing mechanisms to distinguish areas with distinct biogeography as one means to define management units in large marine ecosystems. We use random forests to quantify the relative importance of habitat and environmental variables to the distribution of individual species, and to quantify shifts in multispecies assemblages or community composition along environmental gradients. Threshold shifts in community composition are used to identify regions with distinct physical and biological attributes, and to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables to determining regional boundaries. Depth, bottom temperature and frontal boundaries were dominant factors delineating distinct biological communities in this system, with a latitudinal divide at approximately 60°N. Our results indicate that distinct climatic periods will shift habitat gradients and that dynamic physical variables such as temperature and stratification are important to understanding temporal stability of ecoregion boundaries. We note distinct distribution patterns among functional guilds and also evidence for resource partitioning among individual species within each guild. By integrating physical and biological data to determine spatial patterns in community composition, we partition ecosystems along ecologically significant gradients. This may provide a basis for defining spatial management units or serve as a baseline index for analyses of structural shifts in the physical environment, species abundance and distribution, and community dynamics over time.},

Using a GIS approach, spatial information for 39 marine activities was mapped, including commercial and recreational fishing areas, transportation and infrastructure uses, and terrestrial activities along the coast of British Columbia. 4. A relative scale was used to rank both the impact of marine activities and the extent of stressors beyond the location of occurrence. Limited information on the latter led to the application of three ranges of buffer distances to the data (0-1 km, 0-5 km, and 0-25 km). 5. The most conservative estimate (<= 1 km buffers) indicates at least 83\% of the continental shelf and slope of British Columbia is currently being used by humans. The largest buffer assumption shows 98\% of the continental shelf and slope being affected by stressors from anthropogenic activities. 6. This analysis provides a baseline for assessing future changes in the state of British Columbia's marine environment, and could assist in identifying areas of conservation potential.},

However, our survey of wave attenuation data from field studies of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, nearshore coral reefs, and sand dunes reveals that these relationships are rarely linear. By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand, we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem-based management goals. This result suggests that reconciling competing demands on coastal habitats should not always result in stark preservation-versus-conversion choices.},

Lack of a standardized representation of the coastline, confusing terminology, lack of high-density mapping of the coastal zone, and the inability to translate between various vertical datums are the most serious issues.

  Abstract                 = {We propose here some refinements of the ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) to describe precisely one organismâ€™s habitat selection. The ENFA is based on the concept of the ecological niche, and provides a measure of the realised niche within the available space from the computation of two parameters, the marginality and the specialization. By measuring the departure of the ecological niche from the average available habitat, the marginality identifies the preference of the individual, population, or species for specific conditions of the environment among the whole set of possibilities. The specialization appears as a consequence of the narrowness of the niche on some environmental variables. The ENFA is a factorial analysis that extracts one axis of marginality and several axes of specialization. We present here the use of biplots (i.e., the projection of both the pixels of the map and the environmental variables in the subspace extracted by the ENFA) as a way to identify the key-variables for management, assessing which habitat features are of prime importance and should be preserved or reinforced. With the help of this tool, we are now able to describe much more precisely the habitat selection of the organism under focus. In our application to the lynx in the Vosges mountains, based on sightings as well as other indices of lynx presence, we thus underlined a strong avoidance of agricultural areas by the lynx. We also highlighted the relative indifference of the lynx to the proximity of artificial areas and at the opposite, the sensitivity to the proximity of highways. The ENFA provides a suitable way to measure habitat use/selection under a large range of ecological contexts and should be used to define precisely the ecological niche and therefore identify the characteristics searched for by the organism under study.},

  abstract  = {The concept of the ecological trap, a low-quality habitat that animals prefer over other available habitats of higher quality, has appeared in the ecological literature irregularly for over 30 years, but the topic has received relatively little attention, and evidence for traps remains largely anecdotal. Recently, however, the ecological trap concept has been the subject of a flurry of theoretical activity that is likely to raise its profile substantially, particularly in conservation biology. Ecological trap theory suggests that, under most circumstances, the presence of a trap in a landscape will drive a local population to extinction. A number of empirical studies, almost all of birds, suggest the existence of traps and demonstrate the difficulties of recognizing them in the field. Evidence for ecological traps has primarily been found in habitats modified by human activities, either directly (e.g., through the mowing of grassland birds' nests) or indirectly (e.g., via human-mediated invasion of exotic species), but some studies suggest that traps may occur even in relatively pristine areas. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that traps may be relatively common in rapidly changing landscapes. It is therefore important for conservation biologists to be able to identify traps and differentiate them from sinks. Commonly employed approaches for population modeling, which tend to assume a source-sink framework and do not consider habitat selection explicitly, may introduce faulty assumptions that mask the effects of ecological traps and lead to overly optimistic predictions about population persistence. Given the potentially dire consequences of ecological traps and the accumulating evidence for their existence, greater attention from the community of conservation biologists is warranted. In particular, it is important for conservation biologists and managers to incorporate into conservation planning an explicit understanding of the relationship between habitat selection and habitat quality.},

  abstract  = {The genetic structure of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) populations was examined in an analysis of variation of 14 microsatellite loci representing approximately 1900 fish from 9 sites between the Columbia River and Cook Inlet, Alaska. Significant genetic differentiation occurred among the putative populations. The mean F ST for all loci was 0.0046, and there was a significant correlation between population genetic differentiation (F ST) and geographic distance. Simulated mixed-stock samples comprising populations from different regions suggested that variation at microsatellite loci provided reasonably accurate estimates of stock composition for potential fishery samples. Marine sampling indicated that immature eulachons from different rivers, during the 2 to 3 years of prespawning life in offshore marine waters, do not mix thoroughly. For eulachons captured incidentally in offshore trawl fisheries, there was a clear geographic cline in relative abundance of eulachons from different geographic areas. The sample from northern British Columbia was dominated by northern and central coastal populations of British Columbia, the sample from central British Columbia was composed of eulachons from all regions, and the sample from southern British Columbia was dominated by Columbia River and Fraser River populations. These results have implications for the management of trawl fisheries and conservation of spawning populations in some rivers where abundance is at historically low levels.},

Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},

  Abstract                 = {Large fluctuations in the trends of Pacific salmon production in this century have been linked to trends in climate in the Pacific that are in turn associated with climate trends throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The close correspondence in the persistence of climate trends and the synchrony of the changes is evidence that a common event may cause the regime shifts. The trends or regimes can be characterized by stable means in physical data series or multiyear periods of linked recruitment patterns in fish populations. The regime concept is important in fisheries management because the natural shifts in abundance may be large and sudden, requiring that these natural impacts be distinguished from fishing effects. An equally important consideration is that biological and physical mechanisms may change when regimes shift, resulting in conditions that may not be characterized in the earlier part of the data series. Fluctuations in Pacific salmon abundance in this century were synchronous with large fluctuations in Japanese sardine abundance, which can be traced back to the early 1600’s. The synchrony in the fluctuations suggests that Pacific salmon abundance may have fluctuated for centuries in response to trends in climate. The concept of regimes and regime shifts stresses the need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of fish and their ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {The kelp species Laminaria hyperborea constitutes highly productive kelp forest systems hosting a broad diversity of species and providing the basis for commercial kelp harvesting and, through its productivity, the fishing industry. Spatial planning and management of this important habitat and resource needs to be based on distribution maps and detailed knowledge of the main factors influencing the distribution. However, in countries with a long and complex coastline, such as Norway, detailed mapping is practically and economically difficult. Consequently, alternative methods are required. Based on modelled and field-measured geophysical variables and presence/absence data of L. hyperborea, a spatial predictive probability model for kelp distribution is developed. The influence of depth, slope, terrain curvature, light exposure, wave exposure, and current speed on the distribution of L. hyperborea are modelled using a generalized additive model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion, we found that the most important geophysical factors explaining the distribution of kelp were depth, terrain curvature, and wave and light exposure. The resulting predictive model was very reliable, showing good ability to predict the presence and absence of kelp.},

Personal autarky poses a serious danger of collapse in cases of illness, drought, etc. Trade reduces the impact of local catastrophes, thus increasing economic stability. However, the recent series of econo-crises revealed that globalization induces coherence among markets and jeopardizes their sustainability against global failures. Economists try to identify the optimal tariff that balances between the dangers of autarky and the risk of correlated failure. The same problem appears in ecosystems with a population divided among local habitat patches. Optimal tariff is translated to optimal migration rate: how should one manipulate connectivity among patches in order to achieve maximum sustainability? Recolonization of habitats that undergo extinction is essential for survival, yet a too strong dispersal leads to coherence and correlated extinction. Here we use individual-based models in order to find the optimal migration rate. We show that this optimum appears when the the system takes a spatialcheckerboard pattern that maximizes the decoherence. The insights gleaned allow for improved policies for conservation of endangered species (optimizing the effect of corridors, predicting the impact of habitat fragmentation) and, on the other hand, eradication campaigns (like vaccination or pest control).},

  Abstract                 = {Some fishery characteristics such as total discards are often inferred from data collected by at-sea observers on a subset of fishing trips. Such inference is predicated on the assumption that observed and unobserved trips are statistically exchangeable. There are two principal reasons why this may not be so. A deployment effect results from nonrandom distribution of observers among sampling units. An observer effect results from changes in fishing practice or location when observers are present. Both effects can impact the precision and accuracy of fishery-level inferences drawn from observer data, though this is rarely addressed quantitatively. We found evidence for deployment and observer effects in Gulf of St. Lawrence fisheries. The impact of deployment bias was further quantified by resampling from fisheries data collected with 100% observer coverage. We conclude that the nature of the effects observed in our study preclude merely correcting observer-collected catch data for possible biases and imprecision. Furthermore, regulatory compliance monitoring by observers in the existing program may not be completely effective. Modifications to program structure would therefore be beneficial and some suggestions are evaluated in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {This volume, in 4 parts, contains the theoretical development of simple and complex deterministic models, and their application to 2 North Sea fisheries. Four primary factors which change the total weight of the fishable stock, recruitment, growth, capture, and "natural" death, are considered. 
I. The development of a theory of fishing, each factor represented by constant and independent parameters. The 4 primary factors are brought together by considering a year-class of recruits to the fished area, and by applying the other 3 factors to deduce the total yield of the year-class throughout its life, equivalent to the steady state yield in 1 year from all year-classes. From this equation are derived expressions for yield in number, catch per unit of effort, population number, population biomass, and mean length, weight and age of fish in the population and in the catch. 
II. The theory is extended to include the effects of change in, and interaction between, primary factors. Recruitment is usually but not always independent of population density in marine fishes. A relationship between egg-production (E) and recruitment (R) is developed, in which R approaches an asymptote as E increases indefinitely, with E proportional to adult stock weight and prerecruit mortality rates a linear function of the density of young fish. Since E is related to biomass, fecundity and pre-recruitment mortality can be substituted for the recruitment terms in the yield equation. To test whether a regulated fishery is behaving as expected, a model is derived relating variations in R and annual yield. Other possible types of relationship between R and E are considered more briefly. Capture and natural death: Variations with age in both natural (M) and fishing (F) mortality are considered; M in relation to stock density, F to mesh selection and ability to avoid the net. Methods are developed for dealing with seasonal variation in fishing intensity and with "transitional" periods between periods of steady state. The lack of uniformity in the spatial distribution of fish and fishing effort, involving an analysis of the movements within the exploited area is investigated. Growth: Even though growth is variable, von Bertalanffy's equation remains the most suitable formulation. Methods are discussed Df considering variations in growth with age, between individual fish, and due to dependence on food consumption. The latter is treated mainly by an analysis of the interaction between the fish population and its food supply, including the dynamics of the latter. Equations are derived for actual and maximal food consumption of a fish population in terms of its abundance, age-composition, and growth rate. Consideration of the effects introduced by predation on 2 or more food species lead to a review of methods of reporting food preference and vulnerability. Methods developed for populations of single species are extended to fisheries based on several species caught together by the same gear. 
III. Estimation of parameters for North Sea plaice and haddock stocks. A basic unit of standardized fishing effort of a steam trawler ton-hour is suggested, and the same per square mile as an index of density. Estimates of the total fishing mortality coefficient (F+M), made from catch per unit of effort and age-composition data were 0.83 for plaice and 1.2 for haddock during the inter-war period. Methods of obtaining separate estimates of F and M from marking experiments are discussed; 2 earlier methods are found to be erroneous and a simple method of estimating F, clear of rate of shedding of marks and other errors is given. An average value of F of 1.5 for plaice was obtained for the most heavily fished portions of the southern North Sea during the post-war period. The magnitudes of dispersion to other areas, and of shedding rates prevented any estimate of M. In considering the variation in F with age as a result of mesh selection, a close proportional relation between the 50% selection point and mesh size was found, the factor being 2.2 for plaice and 3.3 for haddock. Separate estimates of F and M from age-composition and effort data were not possible. However, data on the abundance of certain year-classes sampled both in 1938-39 and 1945-46 yielded an estimate of M of 0.1 for plaice in the prewar period. F was thus 0.73. Although no accurate estimate of M for haddock is available, certain age-composition data suggest it is not much greater than 0.2. F for the pre-war period was thus 1.0. In North Sea plaice, recruitment (R) occurs by an off-shore movement, following the law of random diffusion at a rate of about 1 mile a day. About 90% of the recruits are in age-groups IE and IV, the average age being 3.7 years. In the earlier war period average R was 250 million plaice and 850 million haddock. The fishable stock of plaice averaged 350 million. While there is some indication of a relation between egg-production and recruitment in haddock, in plaice results are inconclusive. A review of this relationship in certain other species is also given. In growth equations, the simple cube length-weight relationship appears in plaice and haddock; an allometric expression is not recommended. Von Bertalanffy's equation is fitted to data for plaice, haddock, cod and sole. In plaice and haddock, an empirical relation between growth and population density is found, derived from data referring in the former to steady states, in the latter to annual fluctuations. The dependence of growth on feeding and food supply is examined in plaice only. Maintenance food requirements are almost exactly proportional to the two-thirds power of body weight; the efficiency of utilization 9f Mytilus flesh for growth is about 0.2. An analysis of the variation of utilization efficiency with amount of food eaten showed that the limiting growth parameter (Wimage l) is in order of magnitude some 5 or 6 times Wimage for North Sea plaice. 
IV. The properties of various theoretical models and conclusions drawn therefrom. The simple models show that a greater steady state yield of plaice and haddock than in the prewar period could be obtained with either a lower fishing intensity (affecting F) or a larger mesh size (affecting the age, tpimage at which the fish enter the exploited phase). An even greater yield would result by adjustment of both F and tpimage than by either alone. Variation of population biomass, numbers, average size and age of fish in the catch with F and tpimage are examined. Relatively small differences in plaice yield occur with changes in maximum age, except at low values of F, and with M within 50% of its estimated value (0.1). In the more complex models, the more exact representation of some properties, e.g. mesh selection and recruitment, produce little difference in the yield curves when compared to simpler approximations. Variation with population density can cause important differences. When M increases linearily with density, yield curves have lower maxima, located closer to prewar values of F and iff than with M constant. When the dynamics of food populations are introduced, yield curves resemble those obtained with a linear relationship, thus indicating that the latter is likely to give reasonably satisfactory assessments of the effects of density dependent growth. Where recruitment depends on stock size, both recruitment and growth should be simultaneously density dependent. Changes in recruitment can then still outweigh those in growth, causing yield curves to have higher maxima than if all factors were density independent. Yield curves are little affected if fishing is restricted to not less than three-quarters of the stock area. With further reductions, the maxima become less marked and occur at higher values of F as in a coastal fishery where the main bulk of the population is unfished but acts as a reserve. In general, when complex changes in the primary factors are considered, the actual changes in fishing intensity and especially in mesh size required to produce a larger steady yield are not as great as would be predicted from simple models. In a discussion of the general principles and methods of fishery regulation, the concept is developed of eumetric fishing - the achievment, by adjustment of gear selectivity, of the greatest yield possible with any particular amount of fishing. Yield increases with increasing fishing intensity but at a decreasing rate and without passing through a maximum. When these assumptions apply, the conventional idea of adjusting the amount of fishing to obtain the maximum steady state yield must be abandoned. The decision as to which point on a eumetric yield curve a fishery is to operate is economic and social, depending on how much of the maximum potential profit is to be realized as such and how the remainder is to be absorbed. To obtain the benefits of gear selectivity some control of fishing power is essential. The greatest yield of demersal fish from the North Sea, compatible with avoiding any serious loss of sole or whiting, would be obtained with a fishing effort not more than half, and perhaps less, of the pre-war effort, and a mesh size of 80 to 90 mm. The increase in yield could be 25 to 50%. The proposals of the 1946 Overfishing Conference to reduce overall fishing effort to 85% of the pre-war level and to increase mesh size to 80 mm may result in an increase of 6 to 10% in the total landings of the 4 major North Sea trawl fisheries.},

Linear regression models were fitted to daily logbook data from a multispecies penaeid trawl fishery in which within-vessel changes in effi- ciency are common. Two model-fitting strategies were compared. The predictive strategy focused on maximizing the explained var- iance, and the estimation strategy on finding realistic coefficients for important components of changing catchability. Realistic values could not always be obtained, because the regression factors were not orthogonal, and data on the presence of technology were some- times unreliable or systematically incomplete. It was not possible to separate fishing power from abundance by analysing logbook data alone; it was necessary to incorporate external information within the standardization model. Therefore, the resultant estimation models incorporated external information and expert knowledge by offsets. There was no single best estimation model. Instead, a series of models provided an envelope of possible changes in relative fishing power and prawn abundance since 1970. Compared with the prediction models, the estimation models revealed different trends in relative fishing power and relative abundance.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Conservation and restoration goals are often defined by historical baseline conditions that occurred prior to a particular period of human disturbance, such as European settlement in North America. Nevertheless, if ecosystems were heavily influenced by native peoples prior to European settlement, conservation efforts may require active management rather than simple removal of or reductions in recent forms of disturbance. We used pre-European settlement land survey records (1859--1874) and contemporary vegetation surveys to assess changes over the past 150 years in tree species and habitat composition, forest density, and tree size structure on southern Vancouver Island and Saltspring Island, British Columbia, Canada. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that frequent historical burning by native peoples, and subsequent fire suppression, have played dominant roles in shaping this landscape. First, the relative frequency of fire-sensitive species (e.g., cedar [Thuja plicata]) has increased, whereas fire-tolerant species (e.g., Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii]) have decreased. Tree density has increased 2-fold, and the proportion of the landscape in forest has greatly increased at the expense of open habitats (plains, savannas), which today contain most of the region's threatened species. Finally, the frequency distribution of tree size has shifted from unimodal to monotonically decreasing, which suggests removal of an important barrier to tree recruitment. In addition, although most of the open habitats are associated with Garry oak (Quercus garryana) at present, most of the open habitats prior to European settlement were associated with Douglas-fir, which suggests that the current focus on Garry oak as a flagship for the many rare species in savannas may be misguided. Overall, our results indicate that the maintenance and restoration of open habitats will require active management and that historical records can provide critical guidance to such efforts.},

Agencies that manage protected species—including the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service—are tasked with recovering these populations. But many populations have not been adequately assessed, so recovery cannot be measured. Achieving mandated recovery goals depends on understanding both population trends and the demographic processes that drive those trends. After the 1989 Exxon Valdez Alaskan oil spill, evaluations of effects on wildlife were ambiguous, in part because limited data on abundance and demography precluded detection of change (1). Sadly, the situation in the GoM is similar more than 20 years later. As concluded in the National Commission report on the BP spill (2) released 11 January, “Scientists simply do not yet know how to predict the ecological consequences and effects on key species that might result from oil exposure…” We argue that scientists know how to make these assessments, but lack critical data to achieve this goal.},

The methods we propose are suitable to (1) identify individual habitat patches that are disproportionally high in importance in preserving the ability of organisms to traverse the fragmented landscape, and (2) find internally well-connected compartments of habitat patches that contribute to a spatial compartmentalization of species populations. We demonstrate the utility of these methods using an agricultural landscape with scattered dry-forest patches in southern Madagascar, inhabited by the ring-tailed lemur, Lemur catta . We suggest that these methods are particularly suitable in landscapes where speciesâ€™ traversability is not fully inhibited by fragmentation, but merely limited. These methods are potentially highly relevant in studying spatial aspects of resilience and in the design of natural reserves.},

We use data from four remnant and three translocated sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations to examine relations among magnitude and duration of minimum population size, population growth rates, and genetic variation. Mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotype diversity was correlated with the number of years at minimum population size (rs = -0.741, p = 0.038) and minimum population size (rs = 0.709, p = 0.054). We found no relation between population growth and haplotype diversity, although growth was significantly greater in translocated than in remnant populations. Haplotype diversity in populations established from two sources was higher than in a population established from a single source and was higher than in the respective source populations. Haplotype frequencies in translocated populations of founding sizes of 4 and 28 differed from expected, indicating genetic drift and differential reproduction between source populations, whereas haplotype frequencies in a translocated population with a founding size of 150 did not. Relations between population demographics and genetic characteristics suggest that genetic sampling of source and translocated populations can provide valuable inferences about translocations.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea otter Enhydra lutris populations were severely affected by the 1989 `Exxon Valdez' oil spill in western Prince William Sound, AK, and had not fully recovered by 2000. Here we present results of population surveys and incorporate findings from related studies to identify current population status and factors affecting recovery. Between 1993 and 2000, the number of sea otters in the spill-area of Prince William Sound increased by about 600 to nearly 2700. However, at Knight Island, where oil exposure and sea otter mortality in 1989 was most severe, no increase has been observed. Sea otter reproduction was not impaired, and the age and sex composition of captured otters are consistent with both intrinsic reproduction and immigration contributing to recovery. However, low resighting rates of marked otters at Knight Island compared to an unoiled reference area, and high proportions of young otters in beach cast carcasses through 1998, suggest that the lack of recovery was caused by relatively poor survival or emigration of potential recruits. Significantly higher levels of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), a biomarker of hydrocarbons, were found in sea otters at Knight Island from 1996 to 1998 compared to unoiled Montague Island, implicating oil effects in the lack of recovery at Knight Island. Delayed recovery does not appear to be directly related to food limitation. Although food availability was relatively low at both oiled and unoiled areas, we detected significant increases in sea otter abundance only at Montague Island, a finding inconsistent with food as a principal limiting factor. Persistent oil in habitats and prey provides a source of continued oil exposure and, combined with relatively low prey densities, suggests a potential interaction between oil and food. However, sea otters foraged more successfully at Knight Island and young females were in better condition than those at Montague Island. We conclude that progress toward recovery of sea otters in Prince William Sound is evident, but that in areas where initial oil effects were greatest, recovery may be constrained by residual spill effects, resulting from elevated mortality and emigration. It is evident that internal reproduction and immigration of juveniles has been the primary means of population recovery, as opposed to broad scale redistribution of adults from outside affected areas. The result is a recovery period protracted by long-term spill effects on survival and emigration and intrinsic limits to population growth.},

In some cases, scientists instead use data on productivity of nursery lakes; however, many such analyses have not accounted for uncertainties. We therefore extended a previously developed lake productivity method for estimating escapement goals (the photosynthetic rate (PR) model) by using a Bayesian statistical approach that takes several sources of uncertainty into account. Utilizing data for Fraser River, British Columbia, sockeye salmon stocks, we compared this Bayesian PR method with stock?recruitment analysis. In six of seven cases, probability distributions of spawner abundance goals from the Bayesian PR method were 27% narrower on average than those from the stock?recruitment method. In four of seven cases, the Bayesian PR method produced higher median estimates of target spawner abundance than did stock?recruitment analysis; the other three pairs of estimates were within 7% of one another. We suggest that the Bayesian PR method is a potential alternative to using stock?recruitment data to estimate escapement goals for sockeye salmon populations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents optimum sampling levels in discard sampling programs considering cost and precision objectives simultaneously and explores their dependence on both variables. The analysis is based on the Irish discard program: an onboard-observer voluntary sampling scheme aimed at estimating discard rates in trawl fisheries. Multi- stage analysis was performed to establish the precision levels achieved in the past, and a cost function was determined to estimate the financial cost of the program. Gear, fishing ground, targeted species, and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions were the main factors affecting discarding, together with random effects of the three nested groups considered: haul, trip, and vessel. Reductions in the present budget will imply only marginal de- creases in precision, although changes in cost variables can have an impact on sampling levels. On the other hand, increasing the target precision by one-half will imply a considerable increase in sampling and associated cost, which will be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Finally, the analysis by fleet components suggests a marked increase in sampling levels, which emphasizes the importance of clearly stated discard sampling objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory underlying the design of marine reserves, whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries, is still in its infancy. For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {{Recent calls to incorporate ecosystem-based approaches, which consider multiple physical and biological aspects of a system instead of a single stock, into fisheries management have proven challenging to implement. Here, we suggest that managers can use the diversity of species in an area and the presence of foundation species as two indicators of marine ecosystem functioning. We used data from the 2006 sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) test fishery in the inside waters of southeastern Alaska to evaluate the relationship between the diversity of fish species present in an area and the abundance of both target and total fish caught. We found that areas where more fish species were present were characterized by higher catch levels of both sablefish and total fish, suggesting that diversity may be a reasonable indicator of fishery yields and productivity. Furthermore, because the incidence of deep-water coral was also logged in the surveys, we explored the relationship between coral, which provides habitat for groundfish, and catch levels. We found that abundances were highest where coral was present. Finally, we conducted meta-analyses of the importance of marine foundation species, such as corals, kelps, seagrasses, and oyster reefs, in promoting the diversity and abundance of associated taxa and found that diversity was 1.4-fold higher and abundances were 3.4-fold higher where these habitat-forming species were present. Together, these results suggest that biodiversity and the presence of foundation species can serve as useful indicators of a marine ecosystem's ability to provide the goods, services, and functions that we and other orgranisms rely, on. We therefore suggest that these indicators be incorporated into fisheries management strategies.}},

Hydroacoustic surveys across the northeast Newfoundland shelf in 1990, 1995, and 2000 showed the distribution of the remaining large aggregations of cod to be concentrated in inshore embayments, which is contrary to historic patterns. Inshore surveys on the south coast identified local spawning aggregations at specific geographic locations, to which adults homed in subsequent years. Dispersal of eggs and larvae to the offshore occurred during spring, but was localized (within bay) in the warm summer months. Abundance of age-0 cod increased with proximity to spawning location inshore, suggesting self-recruitment within local embayments. Age-2â€“3 juveniles actively selected structurally complex habitat at scales of less than tens of kilometers, with home ranges typically less than 10&#xa0;ha. Juveniles were associated with specific habitat types, especially at age 0, in both lab and field experiments. Our results suggest that self-recruitment and critical life-history events (e.g., spawning, settlement, and maturity) may occur within local embayments, which currently assume much greater importance to overall cod stock dynamics than in the past. Given evidence for limited dispersal, and the inshore presence of critical habitat for early life-history stages, spatial management tools that consider local dynamics may provide a greater degree of protection for coastal Newfoundland cod than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {Under individual transferable quotas (ITQs), participants receive a share of the total allowable catch (TAC), can choose when to fish, and can sell or lease their share. ITQs generally increase fishing flexibility, improve profitability, reduce overcapitalization, and may improve sustainability of the resource through increased stewardship incentives. However, ITQs may increase high-grading and discarding, and create social problems because quota owners have increased control compared to other stakeholders. The U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery is managed under two-monthly landing limits (not ITQs) for each species and has generally high discard levels. The British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery (B.C. fishery) is an ITQ fishery with full observer coverage, where marketable discard mortality is deducted from quotas. Under this system, total discards declined for most species, and marketable discards declined from 0.20% to 0.10%, after an adjustment period. The B.C. system would likely reduce discards in the West Coast fishery, although severe catch restrictions on overfished West Coast species may limit these reductions. To predict fishing changes under fishery regulations, a method was developed for defining “fishing opportunities” for each vessel—groups of trawls over the same portion of a fishing ground. This method uses simple clustering method on Euclidean distances between trawls, offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells, and is able to correctly classify simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. The top vessels in the B.C. fishery frequented a wide variety of fishing opportunities (mean 38, range 20–69), in which trawls generally caught similar species. The B.C. fishery is a multispecies fishery with TACs imposed on 22 species. Despite these constraints, skippers were able to adjust the species mixture in their catches to match changes in TACs. Skippers reduced catches of rougheye, shortraker, and yelloweye rockfish by more than 50% when TACs for those species were reduced. However, there was only weak evidence that skippers changed their fishing patterns based on the species mixture of all of the most important species. Instead, a variety of other factors were likely important in determining which fishing opportunities are preferred and avoided in the B.C. fishery.},

  Abstract                 = {A general model is developed for salmon run reconstruction based on catch, escapement, and age composition data. The model is based on “groups” of salmon, each of which share the same characteristics but can differ from other groups in run timing, abundance, gear selectivity, and migration routes. The model is highly flexible so that it can be adapted to a variety of fisheries and can compare the fits of alternative hypotheses to available data. The model is applied to three sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) districts in Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA, to show the effect of allowing age classes to arrive at different times and the impact of including process errors to mimic day-to-day arrival variability. The model predicts that in 2005, Wood River salmon comprised only 54% of the catch in the Nushagak fishing district (but 71% of the escapement), although these predictions are contradicted by genetic data for 2006–2008 showing high harvest rates of Wood River and Nushagak River fish but only light harvest rates of Igushik River fish. The genetics highlight the importance of including stock-specific availability parameters in future versions of the model to account for differences in harvest rates among stocks caught in the same fishing district.},

There was clear evidence of misreporting in the hoki fishery. Misreporting deprives stakeholders of rentals, distorts catch statistics, and threatens the integrity of ITQ systems.

  Abstract                 = {Restoring habitat structure that existed before active and inadvertent fire suppression is thought to be critical to maintaining populations of some rare plants in fire-suppressed habitats. Nevertheless, the impacts of habitat restoration on most endangered plants are poorly understood. Current theory predicts and empirical studies have shown that the reduction of shade or competition (frequently a goal of many habitat restoration projects in degraded fire-dependent ecosystems) benefits plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils by increasing the benefit-to-cost ratio of adaptations for enhanced nutrient capture. Here, I examined how experimental reduction of neighboring plants in a wet longleaf pine community dominated in the ground cover by shrubs and stump sprouts influenced the growth, the reproduction, the carnivorous effort, and the benefits of carnivory in a U.S. federally endangered species, Sarracenia rubra ssp. alabamensis. Two years of data showed no significant effects of neighbor reduction or prey exclusion on any of several indicators of plant performance, nor was there any evidence of a hypothesized morphological trade-off between shade avoidance and prey capture. These results were unexpected. Inadequate replication and atypical precipitation patterns were ruled out as possible explanations. The population studied here (unlike that of a different, but morphologically similar, species growing in a fire-maintained pine grass edge savanna) did not exhibit the ability to respond to variation in competition from neighboring plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Shelf edge canyons are well-known sites of enhanced biomass due to on-shore transport and concentration of zooplankton along their axes, both of which contribute to the high densities of nekton frequently found in these canyons. Using a combination of acoustics, trawling, and in situ observations with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the distribution of pelagic and demersal biota within Pribilof Canyon in the Bering Sea was examined in September of 1995 and 1997. Near-bottom acoustic scattering patterns in the 38 kHz data showed high concentrations of biomass beginning around the 180 m bottom depth contour and continuing to about 220 m, which were presumed to be adult fish based on their target strength distributions. The 120 kHz data also showed very strong scattering in the water column between 150 and 175 m, which was absent from the 38 kHz data, and therefore attributed mainly to zooplankton. The dominant taxa collected in bottom trawls and mid-water plankton tows were adult rockfishes (Pacific ocean perch, Sebastes alutus) and euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.), respectively. In situ videos revealed dense aggregations of these rockfishes inhabiting a #forest# of attached sea whips, Halipteris willemoesi, during night deployments of the ROV, while areas with damaged sea whips had far fewer rockfish, and areas without this biotic habitat structure had no rockfish. During the day, the rockfishes were seen above the #forest#, where they were apparently feeding on dense swarms of euphausiids. It appears that these rockfish utilize this predictable and abundant food resource in the canyon during the day and are associated with the sea whip habitat at night during periods of inactivity. More research is needed on these slow-growing biotic habitats and how fishing activities in the Bering Sea and elsewhere may impact these habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {The domestic longline fishery operating off the east coast of Australia incidentally takes over 80 non-target species. A significant amount of this non-target catch is retained as byproduct. Total retained byproduct increased through the 1990s to peak at just over 1300 mt (19.6% of total retained catch) in 2002. Due to the difficult economic outlook faced by these fisheries (resulting from overcapacity, localised depletions, increased fuel prices, lowered availability of target species and reduced access to export markets) byproduct has become a relatively more important part of some fishers’ catch and income. This paper summarises a recent review of the catch and economics pertaining to 19 key byproduct species taken in the domestic longline fishery, and identifies both opportunities and threats for sustainable fisheries management associated with these trends. A comparative analysis of observer and logbook data suggested under-reporting of catches and discarding for a significant number of these species. There are five key byproduct species, these being albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), rudderfish (Centrolophus niger) and black oilfish (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) which comprise over 90% of the total catch and value of byproduct. With the exception of albacore tuna, the status of most byproduct species is unknown, but with falling catch rates in recent years and significant retention rates, some concern is held for the status of pelagic shark species such as blue shark and shortfin mako. On the other hand, albacore tuna may offer some opportunity for further fishery development.},

  abstract  = {This review examines the various strategies and methods used to produce benthic habitat maps using acoustic remote sensing techniques, coupled with in situ sampling. The applications of three acoustic survey techniques are examined in detail: single-beam acoustic ground discrimination systems, sidescan sonar systems, and multi-beam echo sounders. Over the past decade we have witnessed the nascence of the field of benthic habitat mapping and, on the evidence of the literature reviewed in this paper, have seen a rapid evolution in the level of sophistication in our ability to image and thus map seafloor habitats. As acoustic survey tools have become ever more complex, new methods have been tested to segment, classify and combine these data with biological ground truth sample data. Although the specific methods used to derive habitat maps vary considerably, the review indicates that studies can generally be categorized into one of three over-arching strategies; 1) Abiotic surrogate mapping; 2) Assemble first, predict later (unsupervised classification); 3) Predict first, assemble later (supervised classification). Whilst there is still no widely accepted agreement on the best way to produce benthic habitat maps, all three strategies provide valuable map resources to support management objectives. Whilst there is still considerable work to be done before we can answer many of the outstanding technological, methodological, ecological and theoretical questions that have been raised here, the review concludes that the advent of spatial ecological studies founded on high-resolution environmental data sets will undoubtedly help us to examine patterns in community and species distributions. This is a vital first step in unraveling ecological complexities and thus providing improved spatial information for management of marine systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Many species of conservation concern are spatially structured and require dispersal to be persistent. For such species, altering the distribution of suitable habitats on the landscape can affect population dynamics in ways that are difficult to predict from simple models. We argue that for such species, individual-based and spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) should be used to determine appropriate levels of off-site restoration to compensate for on-site loss of ecologic resources. Such approaches are necessary when interactions between biologic processes occur at different spatial scales (i.e., local [recruitment] and landscape [migration]). The sites of restoration and habitat loss may be linked to each other, but, more importantly, they may be linked to other resources in the landscape by regional biologic processes, primarily migration. The common management approach for determining appropriate levels of off-site restoration is to derive mitigation ratios based on best professional judgment or pre-existing data. Mitigation ratios assume that the ecologic benefits at the site of restoration are independent of the ecologic costs at the site of habitat loss. Using an SEPM for endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers, we show that the spatial configuration of habitat restoration can simultaneously influence both the rate of recruitment within breeding groups and the rate of migration among groups, implying that simple mitigation ratios may be inadequate.},

  Abstract                 = {Marine ecosystems have been exploited for a long time, growing increasingly vulnerable to collapse and irreversible change. How do we know when an ecosystem may be in danger? A measure of the status of individual stocks is only a partial gauge of its status, and does not include changes at the broader ecosystem level, to non-commercial species or to its structure or functioning. Six ecosystem indicators measuring trends over time were collated for 19 ecosystems, corresponding to four ecological attributes: resource potential, ecosystem structure and functioning, conservation of functional biodiversity, and ecosystem stability and resistance to perturbations. We explored the use of a decision-tree approach, a definition of initial ecosystem state (impacted or non-impacted), and the trends in the ecosystem indicators to classify the ecosystems into improving, stationary, and deteriorating. Ecosystem experts classified all ecosystems as impacted at the time of their initial state. Of these, 15 were diagnosed as “ugly”, because they had deteriorated from an already impacted state. Several also exhibited specific combinations of trends indicating “fishing down the foodweb”, reduction in size structure, reduction in diversity and stability, and changed productivity. The classification provides an initial evaluation for scientists, resource managers, stakeholders, and the general public of the concerning status of ecosystems globally.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimum convex polygons (convex hulls) are an internationally accepted, standard method for estimating species' ranges, particularly in circumstances in which presence-only data are the only kind of spatially explicit data available. One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat, and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size, and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat, the magnitude of errors in locations, and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of a-hulls, which are generalizations of convex hulls, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. a-hulls provide an explicit means for excluding discontinuities within a species range. Strengths and weaknesses of alternatives including kernel estimators were examined. Convex hulls exhibit larger bias than a-hulls when used to quantify habitat extent and to detect changes in range, and when subject to differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort and spatial accuracy. a-hulls should be preferred for estimating the extent of and trends in species' ranges.},

This study will characterize the current and emerging oil spill threats by source category, assess the potential impacts of these threats to define overall risk, and examine the current and projected effectiveness of OSPPR initiatives in minimizing these risks. Key issues, problems and focus areas will be identified and targeted for follow-on risk analysis and management activities by the Coast Guard and agency and industry stakeholders.},

  Abstract                 = {The faunal composition of an extensive area (10,000 km2) closed to trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia was compared with that in two adjacent areas open to fishing. Sampling was undertaken over 2 years using a dredge and a prawn trawl. For analysis, we split the study area into a northern and a southern section, and compared adjacent pairs of zones open and closed to trawling, after adjusting for a strong cross-shelf longitudinal gradient using sediment and depth data. The median coefficient of variation for the ratio of biomass in adjacent pairs of open and closed zones was around 15% for both sampling devices. However, the difference between open and closed pairs of zones was not consistent either within species or across species. Instead, these differences were consistent with the moderate difference between the northern and southern halves of the study area. Three reasons are proposed for the lack of measurable difference that could be attributed to trawling. Firstly, the level of trawling in the open area has been relatively low and, because of targeting of concentrations of prawns, it has been unevenly distributed leaving extensive areas unfished. This suggests that trawling has not had a major impact on the demersal fauna of the region. Secondly, illegal trawling in the closed area could also have confounded the results of the study, though logbook records suggest the level of this fishing was low and its extent restricted. Thirdly, the complexity of the region as shown by a north-south difference in fauna of the closed area might obscure any effects of fishing. We also suggest that areas with high habitat diversity ranging from complex structured seabed to relatively clear open muddy or sandy plains do not lend themselves to open versus closed studies because of the differential effect of fishing on the various habitats.},

  abstract  = {Topographical wave exposure indices allow objective assessment of the degree of wave action at coastal sites. We present a grid-based method for rapidly calculating indices at fine spatial resolutions along whole coastlines, and evaluate the power of candidate indices in predicting composition of rocky shore communities. The method has 3 stages: (1) a grid is created from a vector-based digital coastline using geographical information systems (GIS) software; (2) for every coastal cell, wave fetch is determined as the distance to the nearest land cell in 16 angular sectors, using coarse-, medium- and fine-resolution searches of the surrounding cells up to a distance of 200 km; (3) wind energy (average wind speed and proportional occurrence) in each sector is calculated for nearby coastal sites. We calculated the average fetch in each sector (F) and the sum of products of fetch and wind energy (W). A total of 57 species were surveyed at 185 sites in west Scotland for determination of trends with wave indices. Average wave fetch with a 200 m scale grid explained >50% of the variation in the first principal component of the species-sites abundance matrix, with shore extent explaining another 10%. Incorporating wind data in the indices had a negligible effect on predictive power. Species diversity explained 61% of the variance in the second principal component and declined from low to high pelagic primary productivity. Separating direct physical effects from biological effects, such as food supply or grazing could potentially help us better understand the processes structuring biological communities on rocky shores.},

  Abstract                 = {Twelve eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus, Osmeridae) populations ranging from Cook Inlet, Alaska and along the west coast of North America to the Columbia River were examined by restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to elucidate patterns of neutral and adaptive variation in this high geneflow species. A total of 4104 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered across the genome, with 193 putatively adaptive SNPs as determined by FST outlier tests. Estimates of population structure in eulachon with the putatively adaptive SNPs were similar, but provided greater resolution of stocks compared with a putatively neutral panel of 3911 SNPs or previous estimates with 14 microsatellites. A cline of increasing measures of genetic diversity from south to north was found in the adaptive panel, but not in the neutral markers (SNPs or microsatellites). This may indicate divergent selective pressures in differing freshwater and marine environments between regional eulachon populations and that these adaptive diversity patterns not seen with neutral markers could be a consideration when determining genetic boundaries for conservation purposes. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) were similar with the neutral SNP panel and microsatellites and may be utilized to monitor population status for eulachon where census sizes are difficult to obtain. Greater differentiation with the panel of putatively adaptive SNPs provided higher individual assignment accuracy compared to the neutral panel or microsatellites for stock identification purposes. This study presents the first SNPs that have been developed for eulachon, and analyses with these markers highlighted the importance of integrating genome-wide neutral and adaptive genetic variation for the applications of conservation and management.},

  Abstract                 = {The IUCN Red List is the most useful list of species that are at risk for extinction worldwide, as it relies on a number of objective criteria. Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet's biota, particularly local endemics. By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of invertebrates. By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally, co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the classification process. As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter (27%) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically Endangered, 19% as Endangered, 6% as Vulnerable and 8% as Least Concern. The remaining 40% did not have enough data to reach a classification.},

In such cases, the assumption of independently and identically distributed errors can be violated in standard regression models. Based on a recently published review on methods to account for spatial autocorrelation, we describe here a new statistical approach which relies on the theory of wavelets. It provides a powerful tool for removing spatial autocorrelation without any prior knowledge of the underlying correlation structure. Our wavelet-revised model (WRM) is applied to artificial datasets of species’ distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (Poisson or normally distributed response). Making use of these published data enables us to compare WRM to other recently tested models and to recommend it as an attractive option for effective and computationally efficient autocorrelation removal.},

The application of the model is illustrated using data from the mixed demersal fisheries in the Irish Sea, and the effects of including discards in the assessments and on yield-per-recruit are examined. Including discard estimates in the assessment results in increased estimates of stock numbers and increased fishing mortality on age groups that were subject to discarding.

  Abstract                 = {There are now over 100000 protected areas worldwide, covering over 12% of the Earth's land surface. These areas represent one of the most significant human resource use allocations on the planet. The importance of protected areas is reflected in their widely accepted role as an indicator for global targets and environmental assessments.
However, measuring the number and extent of protected areas only provides a unidimensional indicator of political commitment to biodiversity conservation. Data on the geographic location and spatial extent of protected areas will not provide information on a key determinant for meeting global biodiversity targets: 'effectiveness' in conserving biodiversity. Although tools are being devised to assess management effectiveness, there is no globally accepted metric.
Nevertheless, the numerical, spatial and geographic attributes of protected areas can be further enhanced by investigation of the biodiversity coverage of these protected areas, using species, habitats or biogeographic classifications.
This paper reviews the current global extent of protected areas in terms of geopolitical and habitat coverage, and considers their value as a global indicator of conservation action or response. The paper discusses the role of the World Database on Protected Areas and collection and quality control issues, and identifies areas for improvement, including how conservation effectiveness indicators may be included in the database to improve the value of protected areas data as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Money is often a limiting factor in conservation, and attempting to conserve endangered species can be costly. Consequently, a framework for optimizing fiscally constrained conservation decisions for a single species is needed. In this paper we find the optimal budget allocation among isolated subpopulations of a threatened species to minimize local extinction probability. We solve the problem using stochastic dynamic programming, derive a useful and simple alternative guideline for allocating funds, and test its performance using forward simulation. The model considers subpopulations that persist in habitat patches of differing quality, which in our model is reflected in different relationships between money invested and extinction risk. We discover that, in most cases, subpopulations that are less efficient to manage should receive more money than those that are more efficient to manage, due to higher investment needed to reduce extinction risk. Our simple investment guideline performs almost as well as the exact optimal strategy. We illustrate our approach with a case study of the management of the Sumatran tiger, Panthera tigris sumatrae, in Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP), Indonesia. We find that different budgets should be allocated to the separate tiger subpopulations in KSNP. The subpopulation that is not at risk of extinction does not require any management investment. Based on the combination of risks of extinction and habitat quality, the optimal allocation for these particular tiger subpopulations is an unusual case: subpopulations that occur in higher-quality habitat (more efficient to manage) should receive more funds than the remaining subpopulation that is in lower-quality habitat. Because the yearly budget allocated to the KSNP for tiger conservation is small, to guarantee the persistence of all the subpopulations that are currently under threat we need to prioritize those that are easier to save. When allocating resources among subpopulations of a threatened species, the combined effects of differences in habitat quality, cost of action, and current subpopulation probability of extinction need to be integrated. We provide a useful guideline for allocating resources among isolated subpopulations of any threatened species.},

  Abstract                 = {Small seamounts in the Graveyard complex, northern Chatham Rise, were surveyed in May--June 2006. This repeated a survey in 2001 to examine the effects of bottom trawling on seamount benthos, and to monitor changes over time. Eight seamounts (five fished, three unfished) were surveyed for fauna and substrate type using video and still camera equipment mounted in a towed sled, and physical sampling of the benthic fauna was carried out using a small epibenthic sled.
Over 5000 still camera images of the seafloor were examined, of which 3400 were suitable for descriptive and quantitative analyses. K-means partitioning of the images based on substrate composition defined six substrate classes. The occurrence of these classes varied in proportion between seamounts, and was related to the amount of bottom trawling. Substrate diversity was highest on unfished seamounts, which had higher levels of intact scleractinean coral matrix, and lower on fished seamounts where bedrock and coral rubble were predominant. Distributions of 12 major taxa were plotted, highlighting differences between seamounts in coral cover and several faunal groups. Multivariate analyses of faunal distributions by habitat type indicated a number of significant differences between unfished and fished seamounts. Signs of trawl impact (e.g., gouges, wires) were frequent on the fished seamounts, but scarce or absent on the three "unfished" ones. Several preliminary results from comparisons of 2001 and 2006 surveys are presented. Sled catches were examined by a number of taxonomic experts, and 317 taxa have been identified, most to at least genus level.
Multibeam data from previous surveys were analysed using habitat mapping software, and defined five "biologically meaningful" geomorphological classes based on depth and slope. Overlays with faunal distribution from the images indicated the method could be useful in using physical proxies to identify different faunal communities.},

EBSAs are areas worthy of enhanced management or risk aversion. An area is identified as an EBSA if it ranks highly on one or more of three dimensions (Uniqueness, Aggregation and Fitness Consequences), and can be weighted by two other dimensions (Naturalness and Resilience), agreed upon at a national DFO workshop (DFO 2004c). Regional scientific experts were surveyed to identify Important Areas (IAs) of PNCIMA that met the criteria using a modified Delphic process. Thematic layers produced included species of fish, invertebrates, marine mammals, and reptiles, oceanographic features, provincial ecounits and Parks Canada areas of interest. Experts were also asked to provide rankings of each species’ Important Areas identified for each of the five EBSA criteria. The final list of 144 species’ Important Areas is identified in 40 thematic layers. This report describes how these IAs were identified, discusses issues around the EBSA identification process, and includes maps displaying each individual thematic layer.
When taken together the entire group of species’ Important Areas covers almost the entire area of PNCIMA. This indicates that when viewed at this level, the entire PNCIMA is important in some way to one of the 40 species, species groups or habitat features.},

  abstract    = {This report presents the second phase of Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) identification for the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA). In Phase I, experts identified areas worthy of enhanced protection for each species and habitat feature based on five EBSA dimensions: Uniqueness, Aggregation, Fitness Consequences, Naturalness and Resilience. These areas were called Important Areas (IAs). In Phase II three categories of unique physical features were used as the basis for EBSAs. Physical features are useful in these types of area identification exercises because they often form the basis of the ecological communities and provide recognizable physical boundaries for management. The physical features chosen for PNCIMA include oceanographic features, bottleneck areas and the sponge bioherms. For PNCIMA, 15 of these features were identified and mapped and are presented as EBSAs. The overlap of these features with the remaining IAs was analysed; the one excluded was “River Mouths and Estuaries. In total, 95 of the original IAs overlapped with the 15 EBSAs for a correlation of 73%. The biological congruence of each of the EBSAs with the IAs was also examined. The 15 EBSAs had a total area of 45,182 km2 (44.3% of PNCIMA). Individual EBSAs were profiled and their rationalisation using EBSA criteria was provided. It should be noted that Large Ocean Management Area (LOMA)-scale EBSAs are largely non-existent in the archipelago-fjord complex that characterises the mainland coast of British Columbia. This should not imply that regionally important EBSAs do not exist there, but rather that EBSAs there would be more appropriately identified through Coastal Management Area-scale EBSA analyses, which we encourage to be done as part of the PNCIMA process.},

  abstract  = {Despite application of a harvest control rule (HCR) since 1986, abundance of several Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) stocks in British Columbia, Canada, are currently below levels considered adequate for exploitation. An alternative HCR, based on default limit and upper stock reference (USR) points at 0.4 BMSY and 0.8 BMSY, was recently developed under Canada's precautionary fisheries management policy. We simulated the Pacific herring fishery management system to examine whether (i) realized fishery performance over the past 10 years is an expected consequence of applying the existing herring HCR (with a single lower reference point) and (ii) performance could be improved by adopting the Department of Fisheries and Oceans new HCR with limit and USR points. Both HCRs successfully rebuilt stocks to sustainable levels under a high-productivity scenario, but performed poorly when stock productivity was low. The two HCRs were sensitive to stock productivity, because the effect of a target harvest rate (20%) that is independent of productivity was much larger than the effects of biomass reference-point choices. We therefore recommend further research on estimating reference points and sustainable harvest rates for Pacific herring, so that HCRs may be made more responsive to changes in productivity.},

During two cruises to this area in 1994 we made photographic transects at sites of varying depths that experience varying degrees of disturbance from otter trawling and scallop dredging. Differences between sites were quantified by analyzing videos and still photographs of the sea bottom. Videos were analyzed for sediment types and organism abundance. In the still photos, the percentages of the bottom covered by bushy, plant-like organisms and colonial worm tubes (Filograna implexa) were determined, as was the presence/absence of encrusting bryozoa. Non-colonial organisms were also identified as specifically as possible and sediment type was quantified. Significant differences between disturbed and undisturbed areas were found for the variables measured in the still photos; colonial epifaunal species were conspicuously less abundant at disturbed sites. Results from the videos and still photos were generally consistent although less detail was visible in the videos. Emergent colonial epifauna provide a complex habitat for shrimp, polychaetes, brittle stars and small fish at undisturbed sites. Bottom fishing removes this epifauna, thereby reducing the complexity and species diversity of the benthic community.},

To address this deficiency we undertook a meta-analysis of 39 published fishing impact studies. 2, Our analysis shows that inter-tidal dredging and scallop dredging have the greatest initial effects on benthic biota, while trawling has less effect. Fauna in stable gravel, mud and biogenic habitats are more adversely affected than those in less consolidated coarse sediments. 3. Recovery rate appears most rapid in these less physically stable habitats, which are generally inhabited by more opportunistic species, However, defined areas that are fished in excess of three times per year (as occurs in parts of the North Sea and Georges Bank) are likely to be maintained in a permanently altered state. 4. We conclude that intuition about how fishing ought to affect benthic communities is generally supported, but that there are substantial gaps in the available data, which urgently need to be filled. In particular, data on impacts and recovery of epifaunal structure-forming benthic communities are badly needed.},

  abstract  = {Variation at 12 polymorphic isozyme loci was studied in the European beech on the basis of an extensive sample of 389 populations distributed throughout the species range. Special emphasis was given to the analysis of the pattern of geographic variation on the basis of two contrasting measures of genetic diversity, gene diversity (H) and allelic richness, and to their relationship. Measures of allelic richness were corrected for variation in sample size by using the rarefaction method. As expected, maximum allelic richness was found in the southeastern part of the range (southern Italy and the Balkans), where beech was confined during the last ice age. Surprisingly, H was lower in refugia than in recently colonized regions, resulting in a negative correlation between the two diversity measures. The decrease of allelic richness and the simultaneous increase of H during postglacial recolonization was attributed to several processes that differentially affect the two diversity parameters, such as bottlenecks due to long-distance founding events, selection during population establishment, and increased gene flow at low population densities.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an approach that allows production of benthic substrate and habitat maps in fjord environments. This approach is used to support the management of the Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area (MPA) in southeastern Labrador, Atlantic Canada. Multibeam sonar-derived bathymetry, seabed slope, and acoustic reflectance (backscatter) were combined using supervised classification methods and GIS with ground-truthed benthic sampling in order to derive maps of the substrates and main benthic habitats. Six acoustically distinct substrate types were identified in the fjord, and three additional substrate types without a unique acoustic signature were recognized. Ordination by multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity generalized these to four acoustically distinct habitat types. Greatest within-habitat (alpha) diversity was found in the coralline-algae encrusted gravel habitat. Greatest between-habitat (beta) diversity was found in the management Zones 1 and 2, which have the highest level of protection. The study confirmed that the zoning plan for the MPA, which was designed to protect spawning and juvenile fish habitat for a local genetically distinct population of Atlantic cod, afforded highest levels of protection to areas with highest habitat diversity.},

  abstract  = {Carcasses are potentially a valuable source of DNA for genetic studies of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.). They can be collected at spawning grounds across a wide geographic area and include populations in streams in which it is logistically difficult or too intrusive to sample spawning fish. However, the quality and quantity of DNA from salmon carcasses is highly variable. Using a standardized set of microsatellite loci, we investigated the relationship of amplification success and genotyping errors to time since death and locus size in Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) carcasses. Amplification success declined rapidly from death, smaller loci had greater amplification success than larger loci, and genotyping errors were present in 5% of scored samples. Salmon carcasses can be a valuable source of genetic information; however, the level of effort needed to produce accurate and reliable data with microsatellite loci is considerable. Ideally, field collections should be frequent and focus on fresh carcasses. Data replication should also be incorporated into analyses to reduce amplification failures and genotyping errors. New techniques and markers should improve future cost-effectiveness when analyzing degraded tissue samples. However, we recommend that an evaluation of cost and time be performed at the onset of any population genetic study using salmon carcass tissues, regardless of the technique used.},

  Abstract                 = {The Census of Marine Life (2000–2010) was the largest global research programme on marine biodiversity. This paper integrated the findings of reviews of major world regions by the Census and provides a global perspective on what is known and what are the major scientific gaps. Study metrics were regional species richness, numbers of endemic and alien species, numbers of species identification guides and taxonomic experts, and a state-of-knowledge index. The threats to biodiversity were classified across the regions. A poor to moderate correlation between species richness and seabed area, and sea volume, and no correlations with topographic variation, were attributed to sparse, uneven and unrepresentative sampling in much of the global marine environment. Many habitats have been poorly sampled, particularly in deeper seas, and several species-rich taxonomic groups, especially of smaller organisms, remain poorly studied. Crustacea, Mollusca, and Pisces comprised approximately half of all known species across the regions. The proportion that these and other taxa comprised of all taxa varied sufficiently to question whether the relative number of species within phyla and classes are constant throughout the world. Overfishing and pollution were identified as the main threats to biodiversity across all regions, followed by alien species, altered temperature, acidification, and hypoxia, although their relative importance varied among regions. The findings were replicated worldwide, in both developed and developing countries: i.e. major gaps exist in sampling effort and taxonomic expertise that impair society's ability to discover new species and identify and understand species of economic and ecological importance. There was a positive relationship between the availability of species identification guides and knowledge of biodiversity, including the number of species and alien species. Available taxonomic guides and experts correlated negatively with endemic species, suggesting that the more we study the ocean the fewer endemic species are evident. There is a need to accelerate the discovery of marine biodiversity, since much of it may be lost without even being known. We discuss how international collaboration between developed and developing countries is essential for improving productivity in the discovery and management of marine biodiversity, and how various sectors may contribute to this.},

  Abstract                 = {The sampling of commercial marine fisheries for management purposes often displays a key weakness in the form of poor documentation of the scientific basis of sampling and estimation, the assumptions made, and the practical constraints. This paper reviews systematically the theoretical and practical options that can remedy this situation and recommends that decisions be archived in regularly updated ‘Sampling Approach and Modifications’ (SAM) documents. Defining the target population, the observable population (usually a subset of the target), and the assumed links between them is important, along with the distinction between design- and model-based sampling approaches. Fleet-targeted and stock-targeted sampling strategies are contrasted, the latter being much harder to implement. Sampling protocols aimed at estimating quantities of fish landed and discarded, length–frequency distributions, length-related variables such as age, weight and maturity, and ratio variables such as catch per unit of effort and the proportions of discards are discussed, together with the raising of estimates to fleet and/or stock levels. The ideas are summarized in the specific contexts of landings sampling, logbook schemes and sea-going observer surveys. SAMs are commended for enhancing the scientific value of fishery sampling, and for encouraging methodological discussions among users and producers of the data.},

  abstract  = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a widely used tool and has many applications in ecology and conservation biology. Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the 'independent errors' assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species' distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species' distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.},

With a liquid oil fraction of 0.4, we estimated that the average flow rate from 22 April 2010 to 3 June 2010 was 5.6 Ã— 104 Â± 21% barrels/day (1.0 Ã— 10âˆ’1 meter3/second), excluding secondary leaks. After the riser was removed, the flow was 6.8 Ã— 104 Â± 19% barrels/day (1.2 Ã— 10âˆ’1 meters3/second).

  Abstract                 = {We estimated adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) escapement in the Horsefly River between August 06 and October 09, 2005, using a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) imaging system. This project was the first attempt to integrate the DIDSON system operationally into sockeye salmon assessment programmes in British Columbia. Our primary objectives were:
1. To assess the ability of a high-frequency imaging sonar system deployed in a fixed position immediately upstream of a fish deflection weir to produce escapement estimates of migrating adult salmon returning to the Horsefly River.
2. Determine an effective method for data handling and processing to produce updated estimates of fish passage in a timely manner.
3. Determine if increases in passage rate impact the ability to produce estimates of fish passage within the ensonified region.
4. Implement use of in-river accessory equipment to optimise our ability to detect and enumerate fish passage.
5. Test the effectiveness of solar panels and high amperage batteries to power the acoustic system for extended periods.
6. Train field staff to setup and operate a fixed-location hydroacoustic facility so they can manage future deployments of the DIDSON.
Sockeye salmon returning to the Horsefly River were directed through an 11 m wide opening in a weir installed across the river to allow DIDSON enumeration at high-frequency using manual counting techniques. Maximum sockeye salmon passage observed was approximately 8,000 fish per hour during the season. We estimated total sockeye salmon escapement into the Horsefly River from 06 Aug to 09 Oct. Based on analysis of visual counts and DIDSON based counts, we found that the DIDSON data were not biased by undetected fish and we conclude that the DIDSON counts of escapement on the Horsefly River are as accurate as counts of migrating fish through an enumeration fence. We compared the distribution of the on-screen DIDSON length measurements (N = 2874) with length measurements from the tagging site of the mark and recapture project located 100 m downstream of the DIDSON site (N = 6260), and found that both measurements were normally distributed with a single mode and that the mean DIDSON length was significantly larger than the mean length of tagged fish (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that the DIDSON and mark-recapture programme provided estimates of escapement for the same population of sockeye salmon, i.e., neither method was biased relative to the other by selective sampling. We expected that the mean length of fish measured with the DIDSON system would be larger than the mark-recapture programme due to biases in length measurements associated with beam spreading and the downrange resolution of the system as deployed. Empirical corrections for these biases, which are range- and window-length dependent, respectively, can be derived on-site in future applications of the DIDSON technology. We found that overall the DIDSON counts were statistically indistinguishable from comparative visual counts made from the weir, yielding an error of 0% from this source. We made measurements of precision by comparing the manually counted data sets between observers and found the error from this source was ± 6%. The 95% confidence limits (CIs) from temporal sub-sampling ranged from 4 % to 10 % depending on the number of minutes of data used from each hour. Combining the errors from these three known sources gave a total confidence limit of ± 14 % to give a total population estimate of 645,310 ± 90,599. The use of a DIDSON system will allow accurate and cost effective enumeration of sockeye salmon on the Horsefly River for fisheries management purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {In many scientific disciplines, straight line, Euclidean distances may not accurately describe proximity relationships among spatial data. However, non-Euclidean distance measures must be used with caution in geostatistical applications. A simple example is provided to demonstrate there are no guarantees that existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid (i.e. positive definite or conditionally negative definite) when used with a non-Euclidean distance measure. There are certain distance measures that when used with existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid, an issue that is explored. The concept of isometric embedding is introduced and linked to the concepts of positive and conditionally negative definiteness to demonstrate classes of valid norm dependent isotropic covariance and variogram functions, results many of which have yet to appear in the mainstream geostatistical literature or application. These classes of functions extend the well known classes by adding a parameter to define the distance norm. In practice, this distance parameter can be set a priori to represent, for example, the Euclidean distance, or kept as a parameter to allow the data to choose the metric. A simulated application of the latter is provided for demonstration. Simulation results are also presented comparing kriged predictions based on Euclidean distance to those based on using a water metric.},

  abstract  = {Metapopulation dynamics are influenced by spatial parameters including the amount and arrangement of suitable habitat, yet these parameters may be uncertain when deciding how to manage species or their habitats. Sensitivity analyses of population viability analysis (PVA) models can help measure relative parameter influences on predictions, identify research priorities for reducing uncertainty, and evaluate management strategies. Few spatial PVAs, however, include sensitivity analyses of both spatial and nonspatial parameters, perhaps because computationally efficient tools for such analyses are lacking or inaccessible. We developed GRIP, a program to facilitate sensitivity analysis of spatial and nonspatial input parameters for PVAs created in RAMAS Metapop, a widely applied software program. GRIP creates random sets of input files by varying parameters specified in the PVA model including vital rates and their correlations among populations, the number and configuration of populations, dispersal rates, dispersal survival, initial population abundances, carrying capacities, and the probability, intensity, and spatial extent of catastrophes, while drawing on specified parameter distributions. We evaluated GRIP’s performance as a tool for sensitivity analysis of spatial PVAs and explored the consequences of varying spatial input parameters for predictions of a published PVA model of the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). We used GRIP output to generate standardized regression coefficients (SRCs) and nonparametric correlation coefficients as indices of the relative sensitivity of predicted conservation status to input parameters. GRIP performed well; with a single analysis we were able to rank the relative influence of input parameters identified as influential by the PVA’s original author, S. A. Berglind, who used three separate forms of sensitivity analysis. Our analysis, however, also underscored the value of exploring the relative influence of spatial parameters on PVA predictions; both SRCs and correlation coefficients indicated that the most influential parameters in the sand lizard model were spatial in nature. We provide annotated code so that GRIP may be modified to reflect particular species biology, customized for more complex spatial PVA models, upgraded to incorporate features added in newer versions of RAMAS Metapop, used as a template to develop similar programs, or used as it is for computationally efficient sensitivity analyses in support of conservation planning.},

  Abstract                 = {Achieving multiple conservation objectives can be challenging, particularly under high uncertainty. Having agreed to limit seahorse (Hippocampus) exports to sustainable levels, signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) were offered the option of a single 10-cm minimum size limit (MSL) as an interim management measure for all Hippocampus species (>34). Although diverse stakeholders supported the recommended MSL, its biological and socioeconomic implications were not assessed quantitatively. We combined population viability analysis, model sensitivity analysis, and economic information to evaluate the trade-off between conservation threat to and long-term cumulative income from these exploited marine fishes of high conservation concern. We used the European long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) as a representative species to compare the performance of MSLs set at alternative biological reference points. Our sensitivity analyses showed that in most of our scenarios, setting the MSL just above size at maturity (9.7 cm in H. guttulatus) would not prevent exploited populations from becoming listed as vulnerable. By contrast, the relative risk of decline and extinction were almost halved -- at a cost of only a 5.6% reduction in long-term catches -- by increasing the MSL to the size reached after at least one full reproductive season. On the basis of our analysis, a precautionary increase in the MSL could be compatible with sustaining fishers' livelihoods and international trade. Such management tactics that aid species conservation and have minimal effects on long term catch trends may help bolster the case for CITES trade management of other valuable marine fishes.},

Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.thi},

  Abstract                 = {To accurately estimate population dynamics and viability, structured population models account for among-individual differences in demographic parameters that are related to individual state. In the widely used matrix models, such differences are incorporated in terms of discrete state categories whereas integral projection models (IPMs) use continuous state variables to avoid artificial classes. In IPMs, and sometimes also in matrix models, parameterization is based on regressions that do not always model nonlinear relationships between demographic parameters and state variables. We stress the importance of testing for nonlinearity and propose using restricted cubic splines in order to allow for a wide variety of relationships in regressions and demographic models. For the plant Borderea pyrenaica, we found that vital rate relationships with size and age were nonlinear and that the parameterization method had large effects on predicted growth rates (linear IPM: 0.95, nonlinear IPMs: 1.00, matrix model: 0.96). Our results suggest that restricted cubic spline models are more reliable than linear or polynomial models. Because even weak nonlinearity in relationships between vital rates and state variables can have large effects on model predictions, we suggest restricted cubic regression splines to be considered for parameterizing models of population dynamics whenever linearity cannot be assumed.},

  abstract  = {Issues of residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) and spatial scale are critical to the study of species-environment relationships, because RSA invalidates many statistical procedures, while the scale of analysis affects the quantification of these relationships. Although these issues independently are widely covered in the literature, only sparse attention is given to their integration. This paper focuses on the interplay between RSA and the spatial scaling of species-environment relationships. Using a hypothetical species in an artificial landscape, we show that a mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of a species' response to its environment leads to a decrease in the portion of variation explained by environmental predictors. Moreover, it results in RSA and biased regression coefficients. This bias stems from error-predictor dependencies due to the scale mismatch, the magnitude of which depends on the interaction between the scale of landscape heterogeneity and the scale of a species' response to this heterogeneity. We show that explicitly considering scale effects on RSA can reveal the characteristic scale of a species' response to its environment. This is important, because the estimation of species-environment relationships using spatial regression methods proves to be erroneous in case of a scale mismatch, leading to spurious conclusions when scaling issues are not explicitly considered. The findings presented here highlight the importance of examining the appropriateness of the spatial scales used in analyses, since scale mismatches affect the rigor of statistical analyses and thereby the ability to understand the processes underlying spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract 10.1002/rra.779.abs Assessing actual and potential biodiversity of riverâ€“floodplain ecosystems on the basis of policy and legislation concerning endangered and protected species is necessary for consistency between different policy goals. It is thus a prerequisite to sustainable and integrated river management. This paper presents BIO-SAFE, a transnational model that quantifies the relevance of species and ecotopes, characteristic of the main channels and floodplains of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, on the basis of international treaties and directives and national Red Data Lists. BIO-SAFE was developed into a tool for biodiversity assessment with regard to design and evaluation of physical planning projects, Environmental Impact Assessments and comparative landscapeâ€“ecological studies. It was conceived to be applicable in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Taxonomic groups involved are higher plants, birds, herpetofauna, mammals, fish, butterflies, and dragonflies and damselflies. The linkage of habitat requirements of species to ecotopes allows the user to derive information at the level of several ecotope types and scales. The model requires input data on presence of species and/or surface area of ecotopes. BIO-SAFE has been applied to flood risk reduction projects along the rivers Rhine and Meuse. Results show that BIO-SAFE yields quantitative information regarding the degree to which actual situations, reconstruction designs and developments of species and ecotope composition meet national and international agreements on biodiversity conservation. Attuning biodiversity conservation and flood risk reduction measures is a major issue in applied ecology and spatial planning. Assessments with BIO-SAFE can help find an optimal balance. Because of its policy-based character, BIO-SAFE yields information that is complementary to ecological biodiversity indices, single-species habitat models and ecological network analysis. The development of BIO-SAFE was based on species characteristic of rivers and floodplains, but the method can easily be applied to other ecosystems as well.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the potential role of food limitation in constraining the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the `Exxon Valdez' oil spill. The spill resulted in the removal of a large number of sea otters in 1989, and as of 1998, the portion of the population in the heavily oiled northern Knight Island region had not fully recovered. Between 1996 and 1998, prey consumption rate was higher and the condition of sea otters was better at northern Knight Island than in an unoiled area of the sound (Montague Island). Estimates of prey energy available per unit mass of sea otter were about 4 times higher at Knight than Montague Island, albeit not significantly different between the 2 areas. Over this same period, the number of sea otters remained constant at northern Knight Island but increased at Montague Island. These data suggest that food was at least as abundant at Knight than at Montague Island, and that recovery of sea otters via intrinsic population growth was limited by factors other than food. However, the availability of food, the prey consumption rate, and the condition of sea otters were all much lower at both Knight and Montague Islands than in areas newly occupied by sea otters where the population growth rate was near the theoretical maximum. It is possible that the relatively short supply of food (compared to areas where sea otter population growth rate was high) may have inhibited immigration or interacted with other factors (e.g. oil-induced mortality or predation) to restrict sea otter population growth. Nonetheless, these data suggest that impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on large, often food-limited vertebrate predators can persist in spite of the availability of food resources that are sufficient for intrinsic population growth.},

At northern Knight Island, a heavily oiled portion of the sound, sea otter abundance was reduced by a minimum of 50 % by the oil spill, and from 1995 through 1998 remained at an estimated 66 % lower than in 1973. Where sea otter densities were reduced, there were proportionally more large sea urchins. However, except in some widely scattered aggregations, both density and biomass of sea urchins were similar in an area of reduced sea otter density compared with an area where sea otters remained about 10 times more abundant. Furthermore, there was no change in kelp abundance in the area of reduced sea otter density. This is in contrast to greatly increased biomass of sea urchins and greatly reduced kelp density observed following an approximate 90 % decline in sea otter abundance in the western Aleutian Islands. The variation in community response to a reduction in sea otters may be related to the magnitude of the reduction and the non-linear response by sea urchins to changes in predator abundance. The number of surviving sea otters may have been high enough to suppress sea urchin populations in Prince William Sound, but not in the Aleutians. Alternatively, differences in response may have been due to differences in the frequency or magnitude of sea urchin recruitment. Densities of small sea urchins were much higher in the Aleutian system even prior to the reduction in sea otters, suggesting a higher rate of recruitment.},

Biomass distribution of zoobenthos varied greatly (2.6 to 1200 g m-2 wet wt). Average values recorded for the offshore areas are high for an Arctic environment, implying that the influence of the large Pechora River may extend far into the offshore area. In addition, intensive sedimentation of organic matter during the retreat of the highly productive ice-edge zone in the summer may also contribute to the observed high biomass. A method combining the abundance and biomass values of species was used to calculate an index approximating the production of each species. This index was used to distinguish the different community types in the area. In the study area, 13 benthic community types were identified, of which 2 main types covered most of the offshore areas. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediment was shown to have a strong influence on the diversity of the benthic communities, while both TOC and water depth affected the distribution of communities and the feeding mode of the dominant species. A community type consisting of surface deposit-feeders is the most widely distributed type in the area. Suspension feeders, however, dominate an extensive shallow offshore area. Boreal-Arctic species show a marked predomination (68.9%) in the whole Pechora Sea. The share of Arctic species is greater in the northern part influenced by cold water currents, while boreal species predominate in areas affected by warmer coastal waters. These observations indicate that the Pechora Sea functions as a transitional zone between boreal and Arctic biogeographic regions},

Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter. Other less known threats include the use of plastic debris by "invader" species and the absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls from ingested plastics. Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and "scrubbers" are also hazardous.

  Abstract                 = {Sea otter populations throughout their range in the North Pacific were driven to the brink of extinction by the maritime fur trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. In Canada the species was finally extirpated from British Columbia by 1929. To reintroduce the species to Canada, 89 sea otters from Alaska were released into Checleset Bay, west coast Vancouver Island, in 1969, 1970 and1972. The most recent population estimate, from 2001, indicates a minimum population of 3,180 sea otters in Canada. The population occurs in two areas of the west coast. Most animals (2,673) occur along the west coast of Vancouver Island, with the remainder occupying a small section of the central British Columbia coast. Population growth along the west coast of Vancouver Island averaged 19.1% per year from 1977 to 1995, but appears to have slowed to 8.0% per year since 1995. Growth may have slowed because some areas near the centre of the range have reached equilibrium. On the central B.C. coast, growth has average 12.4% per year between 1990 and 2004. Maximum or carrying capacity population estimates for British Columbia suggest that at its current size, the population is below coast wide carrying capacity. The population likely occupies 25 to 33% of its historic range in British Columbia. Habitat is not limiting for the species in Canada at present population level; however, further evaluation would be needed to assess any components that could qualify as critical habitat as defined by SARA. A recommended interim recovery target for sea otters in Canada is to continue the geographic range expansion and growth of the population. Total allowable human-induced mortality, calculated as Potential Biological Removal for the Canadian sea otter population was estimated to be 143 sea otters per year. Should a directed take be considered, it should be geographically distributed and carried out in such a way so as not to constrain achievement of the recovery target. Sea otters are a polygynous species hence mortality of females will have a greater effect on the population than male mortality and this factor should also be considered. Oil spills continue to represent a significant threat to the population. Illegal killing does occur and may be of concern. Other potential threats are also identified.},

  abstract  = {A system of natural reserves, each surrounded by altered habitat, resembles a system of islands from the point of view of species restricted to natural habitats. Recent advances in island biogeography may provide a detailed basis for understanding what to expect of such a system of reserves. The main conclusions are as follows:
The number of species that a reserve can hold at equilibrium is a function of its area and its isolation. Larger reserves, and reserves located close to other reserves, can hold more species.
If most of the area of a habitat is destroyed, and a fraction of the area is saved as a reserve, the reserve will initially contain more species than it can hold at equilibrium. The excess will gradually go extinct. The smaller the reserve, the higher will be the extinction rates. Estimates of these extinction rates for bird and mammal species have recently become available in a few cases.
Different species require different minimum areas to have a reasonable chance of survival.
Some geometric design principles are suggested in order to optimise the function of reserves in saving species.},

  Abstract                 = {We have assessed the current state of knowledge relative to methods used in assessing sub-tidal benthic habitat quality and the classification of benthic habitats. While our main focus is on marine habitat, we extensively draw on knowledge gained in freshwater systems where benthic assessment procedures are at an advanced stage of maturity. We found a broad range of sophistication/complication in terms of the methods applied in assessing and mapping benthic habitats. The simplest index or metric involved some assessment of species richness, while the most complicated required utilizing multi-variate analysis. The simplest mapping attempts equated physical substrate with benthic habitat while the most sophisticated relied on extensive environmental preference and groundtruth data for species of concern. The leading edge of methods for benthic habitat mapping involves combining the advances in optical and acoustic methods that allow for routine classifying and mapping of the seafloor with biological and habitat data for species of concern. The objective of this melding of dispirit methods is to produce benthic habitat maps with broad system wide coverage and sound biological underpinning. It is clear that the disparity in information density between the physical and biological sides of the equation currently hinder applicability and acceptability of benthic habitat mapping efforts. In addition to the lack of basic information on the biological and environmental tolerances of targeted species, the proliferation of metrics for characterizing and assessing biological conditions further clouds the usefulness of any broad scale mapping attempt. The problem of data density mismatch between physical and biological methods will likely not be solved until acoustic methods can routinely resolve the elusive biological components that make a physical substrate a habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of density-mediated indirect effects (e.g., keystone predators) in marine communities has been widely recognized. Behaviorally mediated indirect interactions (BMIIs) may be equally important in marine systems, but have received relatively little attention. BMIIs occur when a change in an "initiator" species causes a behavioral shift in a "transmitter" species that, in turn, affects a "receiver" species. BMIIs between initiator and receiver species can be described by the ecological relationships between initiator and transmitter, and between transmitter and receiver (i.e., predator and prey, competitors, or no relationship), and the nature of the indirect effect on the receiver (i.e., positive or negative). We review published examples of BMIIs in marine communities, showing that BMIIs may create, enhance, ameliorate, or even reverse the sign of the direct interactions between species. Models that only include direct interactions or density-mediated indirect ones cannot predict some of these effects. BMIIs are likely to be ubiquitous in marine communities and have important implications for both understanding community dynamics and managing these systems. A thorough understanding of BMIIs is particularly important for conservation and management, as humans may play the role of an initiator, transmitter, or receiver of these effects in a variety of marine communities.},

The results from this study suggested that fluctuating temperatures enhanced the optimum temperature for the growth of sea cucumbers compared with that at constant temperatures.

  abstract  = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of speciesâ€™ distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {There is considerable argument about the effects of bottom trawling on the benthos. Many studies have been done on recently trawled grounds, where community composition has already been modified, and further effects are likely to be minimal. This study tests the effect of trawling on macroinfaunal assemblages in an area where little or no trawling had occurred in the previous 15 years. A spatially replicated Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) design was used, with adjacent trawl and control corridors. Sampling was done in the same two small sites within each corridor before and after trawling to minimise confounding due to spatial variation. Despite this rigorous design, changes consistent with an effect of trawling were not detected. At only one of the three locations was a potential effect detected. These inconsistent results could be due to different disturbance regimes at each location, influencing the vulnerability of fauna to further disturbance. Given the high levels of variability in infaunal assemblages, however, the changes could also be due to asynchronous natural variation. The combination of high spatial and temporal variability, in association with light trawling gear, means that prawn trawling in South Australia does not have consistent effects on infauna.

  abstract  = {Introduction
Rugosity is an index of surface roughness that is widely used as a measure of landscape structural complexity in studies investigating spatially explicit ecological patterns and processes. This paper identifies and demonstrates significant issues with how we presently measure rugosity and, by building on recent advances, proposes a novel rugosity index that overcomes these issues.
Methods
The new arc-chord ratio (ACR) rugosity index is defined as the contoured area of the surface divided by the area of the surface orthogonally projected onto a plane of best fit (POBF), where the POBF is a function (interpolation) of the boundary data only. The ACR method is described in general, so that it may be applied to a range of rugosity analyses, and its application is detailed for three common analyses: (a) measuring the rugosity of a two-dimensional profile, (b) generating a rugosity raster from an elevation raster (a three-dimensional analysis), and (c) measuring the rugosity of a three-dimensional surface.
Case studies and results
Two case studies are used to compare the ACR rugosity index with the rugosity index most commonly used (i.e. surface ratio rugosity), demonstrating the advantages of the ACR index.
Discussion and conclusions
The ACR method for quantifying rugosity is simple, accurate, extremely versatile, and consistent in its principles independent of data dimensionality (2-D or 3-D), scale and analysis software used. It overcomes significant issues presented by traditional rugosity indices (e.g. decouples rugosity from slope) and is a promising new landscape metric. To further increase ease of use I provide multiple ArcGIS resources in the electronic supplementary materials (e.g. Online Appendix 1: a downloadable ArcToolbox containing two ACR rugosity geoprocessing model tools).},

  abstract  = {Predicting species' potential geographical range by species distribution models (SDMs) is central to understand their ecological requirements. However, the effects of using different modeling techniques need further investigation. In order to improve the prediction effect, we need to assess the predictive performance and stability of different SDMs.
Methodology We collected the distribution data of five common tree species (Pinus massoniana, Betula platyphylla, Quercus wutaishanica, Quercus mongolica and Quercus variabilis) and simulated their potential distribution area using 13 environmental variables and six widely used SDMs: BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Each model run was repeated 100 times (trials). We compared the predictive performance by testing the consistency between observations and simulated distributions and assessed the stability by the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and the 99% confidence interval of Kappa and AUC values. 
Results The mean values of AUC and Kappa from MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM trials were similar and significantly higher than those from BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p<0.05), while the associated standard deviations and coefficients of variation were larger for BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p<0.05), and the 99% confidence intervals for AUC and Kappa values were narrower for MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Compared to BIOCLIM and DOMAIN, other SDMs (MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM) had higher prediction accuracy, smaller confidence intervals, and were more stable and less affected by the random variable (randomly selected pseudo-absence points). 
Conclusions According to the prediction performance and stability of SDMs, we can divide these six SDMs into two categories: a high performance and stability group including MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM, and a low performance and stability group consisting of BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN. We highlight that choosing appropriate SDMs to address a specific problem is an important part of the modeling process.},

Ocean calamities are disruptive changes to ocean ecosystems that have profound impacts and that are widespread or global in scope. However, scrutiny of ocean calamities to ensure that they can be confidently attributed to human drivers, operate at widespread or global scales, and cause severe disruptions of marine social-ecosystems shows that some of the problems fail to meet these requirements or that the evidence is equivocal. A number of biases internal and external to the scientific community contribute to perpetuating the perception of ocean calamities in the absence of robust evidence. An organized auditing of ocean calamities may deliver a more precise diagnosis of the status of the oceans, which may help to identify the most pressing problems that need be addressed to conserve a healthy ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80%) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55%), followed closely by habitat loss (37%), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.},

Pilfering of duck eggs by gulls was correlated with the point in incubation when ducks were trapped and handled. Without trapping, we estimated hatching success would exceed 90%. However, duckling mortality, concentrated in the 1st week posthatching, was positively correlated with the numbers of associated gulls. The survival of ducklings declined to zero when the number of nesting gulls approached 500 pairs. The origin and maintenance of this ecologically unstable relationship is discussed.},

The feasibility of using dual-beam sonar for counting and determining target strength of passing salmon was established during the initial 2 years of the study. A hydroacoustic system was engineered to insonify that area of the river used by migrating chinook salmon. Procedures were developed for in situ calibration of the hydroacoustic system and for estimating abundance and associated variance. Management-level operation of the project began in early July 1987. The estimates of chinook salmon passing the sonar site were consistent with independent estimates based on mark-recapture methods. The temporal, spatial, and target-strength distributions of the tracked fish were consistent with estimates of these distributions made using independent methods. Dual-beam sonar has proven to be a precise method for providing real-time estimates of the passage of upstream-migrating chinook salmon.},

We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

  abstract = {1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions.
2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion.
3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods.
4 The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

However we document a shift from verbal expression to quantitative methods that explicitly incorporate scale into the design of the study. Examples include the development of nested multi-scale studies and experiments conducted over large spatio-temporal scales at the level of estuary or region. We also review novel methods for assessing scale effects in benthic ecosystems. First, gradient or correlative study designs have been developed in order to assess spatial and temporal heterogeneity in benthic ecosystems. These designs involve the careful selection of study site locations along gradients, or recommend nesting small-scale experiments within a broad-scale correlative framework. Secondly, we briefly assess the development of statistical analytical techniques to analyze spatial data and formal mathematical techniques for scaling functional relationships. We believe that the design and analytical advances identified in this review provide a framework for ecologists to address pressing large-scale questions.},

  abstract  = {Demonstrating spatial or temporal gradients of effects on macrobenthic communities can be a useful way of providing strong empirical evidence of natural or anthropogenic disturbance. Gradient designs for environmental assessment are sensitive to change for point source data, enabling the scale of the effects of a disturbance to be readily identified. If the spatial scale that is sampled from the point sourer is adequate. problems of selecting control sites can be avoided. However, sources of spatial variation in macrobenthic communities, which are not related to the impact, can confound the use of gradient designs. This can occur if the natural spatial structure overlaps that of the gradient and cannot be identified either as a location or environmental covariable, The ability to detect point source impacts using a gradient design against natural spatial variability was tested using benthic macrofaunal data collected from Manukau Harbour, New Zealand. Treated sewage wastewater is discharged into the north west area of the Manukau Harbour. Sandflats in the vicinity of the outfall are also subject to physical disturbance from wind-waves and strong tides. Ordination techniques and the testing of a priori predictions were used to try and separate the relative effects of organic and physical disturbance on the benthic communities. While the occurrence of other environmental disturbances along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance makes interpretation of community pattern more difficult, the use of a gradient sampling layout, ordination analysis and the testing of a priori predictions enabled impacts of the anthropogenic and natural environmental disturbances to be interpreted. Gradient designs, therefore, provide a method of assessing complex impacts that operate over broad spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract  = {In ecological analyses of species and community distributions there is interest in the nature of their responses to environmental gradients and in identifying the most important environmental variables, which may be used for predicting patterns of biodiversity. Methods such as random forests already exist to assess predictor importance for individual species and to indicate where along gradients abundance changes. However, there is a need to extend these methods to whole assemblages, to establish where along the range of these gradients the important compositional changes occur, and to identify any important thresholds or change points. We develop such a method, called “gradient forest,” which is an extension of the random forest approach. By synthesizing the cross-validated R2 and accuracy importance measures from univariate random forest analyses across multiple species, sampling devices, and surveys, gradient forest obtains a monotonic function of each predictor that represents the compositional turnover along the gradient of the predictor. When applied to a synthetic data set, the method correctly identified the important predictors and delineated where the compositional change points occurred along these gradients. Application of gradient forest to a real data set from part of the Great Barrier Reef identified mud fraction of the sediment as the most important predictor, with highest compositional turnover occurring at mud fraction values around 25%, and provided similar information for other predictors. Such refined information allows for more accurate capturing of biodiversity patterns for the purposes of bioregionalization, delineation of protected areas, or designing of biodiversity surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {In our statistical practice, we ecologists work comfortably within the hypothetico-deductive epistemology of Popper and the frequentist statistical methodology of Fisher. Consequently, our null hypotheses do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as "we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level," which reflect the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities, based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a Bayesian mode also are more meaningful in environmental policy discussions: e.g., "our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests." Based on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue that a "Bayesian ecology" would (a) make better use of pre-existing data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental decision-making.},

  Abstract                 = {Bottom trawling is one of the most disruptive and widespread human-induced Physical disturbances to seabed communities and has become a global environmental concern. We used a comparative approach to test the hypothesis that persistent otter trawling decreases bottom habitat complexity and biodiversity, increases the abundance of opportunistic species, and benefits prey important in the diet of some commercially valuable fish. We compared two similar and adjacent fishing areas at 180 m off central California in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary: one inside the three-mile coastal zone of restricted fishing with light levels of trawling and one beyond the three-mile limit with high levels of trawling. Differences in fishing effort between the two areas were confirmed and quantified by means of data and tow number statistics from Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) Trawl Logbook records We used still photography, video footage, bottom grab samples, and experimental trawling to compare the physical and biological parameters of the two areas The area with high levels of trawling had significantly more trawl tracks, exposed sediment, and shell fragments and significantly fewer rocks and mounds and less flocculent material than the lightly trawled area Most invertebrate epifauna counted were significantly more abundant in the lightly trawled area. The density of the amphinomid polychaete, Chloeia pinnata, as well as that of oligochaetes, ophiuroids, and nematodes, were higher every year in the highly trawled area and there were significantly fewer polychaete species every year in the highly trawled area. Content analysis of fish guts showed that C. pinnata was a dominant prey item for some of the commercially important flatfishes in both lightly and heavily trawled areas. Our study provides evidence that high levels of trawling can decrease bottom habitat complexity and biodiversity and enhance the abundance of opportunistic species and certain prey important in the diet of some commercially important fishes. Our work also illustrates how constraints currently imposed on fisheries research by the near universal absence of true unfished control sites severely limit our ability to determine appropriate levels of harvest pressure for maintaining sustainable fisheries and marine biodiversity. Valid research in these areas will require marine reserves in which fishing effort and methods can be manipulated in collaborative studies involving fishers, researchers, and resource agencies.},

  Abstract                 = {(1) Counts through time were compiled for five sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations in the north-east Pacific Ocean that were below equilibrium density: Attu Island, south-east Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, and central California. Similar data were obtained from the equilibrium density population at Amchitka Island in 1971 and 1986. (2) Shorelines of Attu and Amchitka islands each were divided into forty-five segments, within which lineal (length of shore at mean higher high water) and areal (mean higher high water to the 10-fathom (18.3-m) depth contour) measures were made of the amount of habitat. (3) Rate of increase for the four northern populations was 17-20% year-1. Density- or size-dependent changes in rate of increase could not be demonstrated for any of these populations. The California population, in contrast, has undergone three apparent growth phases: the early 1900s to the mid-1970s when it increased about 5% year-1; the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s when it declined about 5% year-1; and the mid-1980s to 1988 when it increased about 7% year-1. An exponential growth model accounted for 92-98% of the variation in counts through time in all cases. (4) Population increase at Attu Island was achieved largely by range expansion as opposed to increased density. Range expansion in lineal and areal habitat occurred at 11% and 13% year-1, respectively; neither rate was lower (P > 0.25) than the observed rate of increase in numbers of animals counted. (5) Despite similarities in island size and physical environment, the most conservative estimates of population density at Amchitka Island were > 3 X greater than maximum density estimates for Attu Island. (6) Surveys of Amchitka Island from the mid-1930s through the mid-1980s indicate that the population increased to a peak in the 1940s; declined abruptly thereafter; and subsequently increased to a new and higher equilibrium in the 1960s, where it has since remained. (7) These population data, together with information on sea otter foraging and benthic community structure at Attu and Amchitka islands, suggest that multiple population equilibria exist in this system, emanating from complex trophic interactions low in the food web. I hypothesize that the lower population equilibrium is achieved largely or exclusively on an invertebrate diet consisting principally of herbivorous sea urchins. When unregulated by sea otter predation, the rocky benthos is deforested by sea urchin grazing. As growing otter populations compete increasingly for food, grazing intensity declines and the system shifts to one dominated by kelp beds, in turn leading to increased production, a shift in habitat structure, and population increases of kelp bed fishes. Apparently this new food resource elevates the sea otter population to a higher and more stable equilibrium.},

  abstract  = {We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as {phi}-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and {phi}-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.},

  abstract  = {If conservation efforts are to be successful, it is critical that we understand the relationship between habitat loss and the probability of population extinction. Available evidence suggests a threshold amount of habitat loss at which the probability of population extinction increases from near-zero to near-one following a small additional loss of habitat. The main factors thought to determine this extinction threshold are reproductive rate of the organism, rate of emigration of the organism from habitat, habitat pattern in the landscape (fragmentation), and matrix quality (survival rate of the organism in non-habitat areas). Effective conservation measures require knowledge not only of what factors determine the threshold, but also the relative magnitudes of their effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relative effects of these four factors on the extinction threshold, using a spatially-explicit simulation model. Reproductive rate had the largest potential effect on the extinction threshold. The rate of emigration from habitat also had a very strong predicted effect on the extinction threshold; the higher the rate of emigration, the more habitat was needed for persistence. Matrix quality had a moderate effect, and habitat pattern had a very small predicted effect. The simulations predicted that under certain circumstances up to 58% less habitat is required for population persistence, if a matrix of very low quality is converted to a matrix of very high quality. Matrix quality can be improved by maintaining heterogeneous landscapes with a diversity of vegetated features, and by reducing factors causing direct mortality of dispersers such as road traffic and pesticides. In summary, the simulations suggest that (i) the first priority for conservation should be habitat preservation and restoration, (ii) information on movement rates of organisms is critical for predicting extinction thresholds and (iii) conservation strategies should consider the quality of the whole landscape, including the matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The Fraser River basin in British Columbia has significant environmental, economic and cultural importance. Healthy river conditions through sufficient flows and optimal temperatures are of paramount importance for the survival of Pacific salmon, which migrate upriver toward the headwaters to spawn near the end of their lives. Trends have been detected which indicate that the annual flow and summer temperature have been increasing since the middle of the last century. In this study we examine the observed trend in summer temperature of the Fraser River and compare it with temperatures calculated as part of a global climate model (GCM) simulation in which atmospheric greenhouse gases are increasing. We then use the GCM to consider how these trends might continue through the present century. Both the observations and model indicate that during the last half of the 20th century, the summer temperature near the river mouth has been increasing at a rate of approximately 0.12 °C per decade in August. In this study we use an online method in which river temperatures are calculated directly as part of a GCM simulation and project how summer temperature near the mouth of the Fraser River might change by the end of the present century. The results indicate that between 2000 and 2100 river temperatures will increase in all summer months with a maximum increase of 0.14 °C per decade in August. This result is consistent with an offline modeling study by [Morrison, J., Quick, M.C., Goreman, M.G.G. 2002. Climate change in the Fraser River watershed: flow and temperature projections. Journal of Hydrology, 263, 230-244] in which they used output from two GCMS to drive a hydrologic model and predict future changes in river temperature and supports their contention that the timing and magnitude of the increase could be crucial for salmon migration. Future work can extend this analysis to other river systems in an effort to project the potential effects of climate change on the behavior of the world's large river basins, as well as identify the potential biological effects that may accompany these changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental management decisions are prone to expensive mistakes if they are triggered by hypothesis tests using the conventional Type I error rate (a) of 0.05. We derive optimal a-levels for decision-making by minimizing a cost function that specifies the overall cost of monitoring and management. When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on a ¼ 0.05 carries an expected cost over $5 million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species' value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional a-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical burden of proof in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high.},

  abstract  = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of prediction errors. These may be of two types: false positives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsaturated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological context the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecologists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are described. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

  abstract  = {Estimation of genetic population structure, diversity, and effective population size (Ne ) is important for defining meaningful conservation units and assessing genetic health. Recent conservation concerns in Alaska have highlighted the need for research on Eulachon Thaleichthys pacificus, a species about which relatively little is known. Therefore, genetic variation was assayed at 14 microsatellite loci to investigate the genetic population structure of Alaska Eulachon. This analysis revealed a low degree of genetic divergence (G ST = 0.005) that is structured by broad-scale northern and southern geographic regions. Overall, there is a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting that gene flow is geographically restricted and follows an isolation-by-distance (IBD) model. However, closer analysis reveals an absence of IBD within regions and that gene flow is primarily restricted by the geographic distance between regions, a pattern that better approximates the hierarchical island model. Gene flow is likely restricted between regions by a biogeographical barrier (i.e., the Alexander Archipelago). Alaska Eulachon have high levels of genetic diversity and relatively large Ne estimates of 3,535 and 2,823 for the northern and southern regions, respectively, although a large variance in reproductive success is likely responsible for a low Ne /N ratio. The observed genetic divergence suggests that it would be advantageous to manage the two regions separately to maintain productivity and evolutionary potential for Eulachon. Mixed-stock analysis (MSA) of simulated and known-origin mixtures supports the feasibility of regional stock separation. The northern and southern regions had MSA accuracies that were near or greater than 90% when fish from a single region comprised the mixtures. Further population structure may be present within regions, but additional analyses of collections across sampling years are necessary to clarify the microevolutionary processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A discrete reaction-diffusion model was used to estimate long-term equilibrium populations of a hypothetical species inhabiting patchy landscapes to examine the relative importance of habitat amount and arrangement in explaining population size. When examined over a broad range of habitat amounts and arrangements, population size was largely determined by a pure amount effect (proportion of habitat in the landscape accounted for 196% of the total variation compared to <1% for the arrangement main effect). However, population response deviated from a pure amount effect as coverage was reduced below 30%–50%. That deviation coincided with a persistence threshold as indicated by a rapid decline in the probability of landscapes supporting viable populations. When we partitioned experimental landscapes into sets of “above” and “below” persistence threshold, habitat arrangement became an important factor in explaining population size below threshold conditions. Regression analysis on below-threshold landscapes using explicit measures of landscape structure (after removing the covariation with habitat amount) indicated that arrangement variables accounted for 33%–39% of the variation in population size, compared to 27%–49% for habitat amount. Thus, habitat arrangement effects became important when species persistence became uncertain due to dispersal mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {The declining health of marine ecosystems around the world is evidence that current piecemeal governance is inadequate to successfully support healthy coastal and ocean ecosystems and sustain human uses of the ocean. One proposed solution to this problem is ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP), which is a process that informs the spatial distribution of activities in the ocean so that existing and emerging uses can be maintained, use conflicts reduced, and ecosystem health and services protected and sustained for future generations. Because a key goal of ecosystem-based MSP is to maintain the delivery of ecosystem services that humans want and need, it must be based on ecological principles that articulate the scientifically recognized attributes of healthy, functioning ecosystems. These principles should be incorporated into a decision-making framework with clearly defined targets for these ecological attributes. This paper identifies ecological principles for MSP based on a synthesis of previously suggested and/or operationalized principles, along with recommendations generated by a group of twenty ecologists and marine scientists with diverse backgrounds and perspectives on MSP. The proposed four main ecological principles to guide MSPâ€”maintaining or restoring: native species diversity, habitat diversity and heterogeneity, key species, and connectivityâ€”and two additional guidelines, the need to account for context and uncertainty, must be explicitly taken into account in the planning process. When applied in concert with social, economic, and governance principles, these ecological principles can inform the designation and siting of ocean uses and the management of activities in the ocean to maintain or restore healthy ecosystems, allow delivery of marine ecosystem services, and ensure sustainable economic and social benefits.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein electrophoresis was used to determine the relative spawning success of jack sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, males when they joined spawnings of larger, older individuals in experimental enclosures in the natal stream, Pierre Creek, Babine Lake, British Columbia. We attempted to relate the results to distance of the jack from female before spawning and relative size of the jack to the alpha male. Further, we measured the relationships between relative gonad size and available sperm volume to body size to determine if sperm competition could also play a role in determining the relative spawning success of males. Jack spawning success was variable (3-93%) and not significantly different from that of large males, even though they were further from the female before spawning, had smaller gonads, and had less available sperm. Jack males were adept at sneaking, usually commencing spawning within a split second of the alpha male and always on the opposite, free, side of the spawning female. The results are related to various theories on the evolution of alternative mating strategies and tactics in Pacific salmon.},

Three different types of subsampling designs (random, systematic and systematic-cluster) with small sample sizes (50 and 64 points), obtained from this larger data set (200 points), are evaluated. The sensitivity of the spatial methods in the detection and the reconstruction of spatial patterns following the application of the various subsampling designs is discussed. We find that the type of sampling design plays an important role in the capacity of autocorrelation coefficients to detect significant spatial autocorrelation, and in the ability to accurately reconstruct spatial patterns by kriging. Sampling designs that contain varying sampling steps, like random and systematic-cluster designs, seem more capable of detecting spatial structures than a systematic design.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on several years of data from two populations of the endangered Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo, L. 1758), we study how the amount and spatial location of patches of larval (host-plant) and adult (nectar plant) resources affects the distribution of females and their larval offspring in the following year. In the coastal population (nectar-plant and host-plant patches spatially segregated), females moved frequently between patches to aggregate on larger host-plant patches close to nectar-plant patches. In the archipelago population (where nectar-plants and host-plants co-occur), the abundance of females increased with higher proximity to other host-plant patches and with more nectar-plants on the patch. Next year's larval abundance correlated with the abundance of females in the previous season in both populations. A model of the population dynamics in the two populations in relation to the spatial configuration of nectar and host-plant patches showed that the spatial configuration of larval and adult resources had population-dynamical consequences. In many organisms, different life-history stages use different resources. Incorporation of information on the location and abundance of adult resources can provide additional insight for the suitability of a particular landscape in harbouring a population.},

Fishing logbook data indicate that the entire reporting area was trawled about one and a half times on an average annual basis and that some areas were trawled over three times annually. High-resolution sidescansonar images of the study area revealed deep gouges on the seafloor, caused by heavy steel trawl doors that act to weigh down and spread open the bottom trawls. These trademarks are commonly oriented parallel to bathymetric contours and many could be traced for several kilometers. Trawl marks showed a quadratic relationship in relation to water depth, with the greatest number of trawl marks observed at similar to 400 m. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of trawl marks observed on the sidescan images and the number of annual trawl hours logged within reporting areas. This finding indicates that acoustic remote sensing is a promising independent approach to evaluate fishing effort on a scale consistent with commercial fishing activities. Bottom trawling gear is known to modify seafloor habitats by altering benthic habitat complexity and by removing or damaging infauna and sessile organisms. Identifying the extent of trawling in these areas may help determine the effects of this type of fishing gear on the benthos and develop indices of habitat disturbance caused by fishing activities.},

The main objective of this research is to assess and map the ecosystem services provided by benthic habitats in the European North Atlantic Ocean, in the context of the "Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services" (MAES) programme, the European Biodiversity Strategy and the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In total, 62 habitats have been analyzed in relation to 12 ecosystem services over 1.7 million km2. Results indicated that more than 90% of the mapped area provides biodiversity maintenance and food provision services; meanwhile, grounds providing reproduction and nursery services are limited to half of the mapped area. Benthic habitats generally provide more services closer to shore rather than offshore, and in shallower waters. This gradient is likely to be explained by difficult access (i.e., distance and depth) and lack of scientific knowledge for most of the services provided by distant benthic habitats. This research has provided a first assessment of the benthic ecosystem services on the Atlantic-European scale, with the provision of ecosystem services maps and their general spatial distribution patterns. Regarding the objectives of this research, conclusions are: (i) benthic habitats provide a diverse set of ecosystem services, being the food provision, with biodiversity maintenance services more extensively represented. In addition, other regulating and cultural services are provided in a more limited area; and (ii) the ecosystem services assessment categories are significantly related to the distance to the coast and to depth (higher near the coast and in shallow waters).},

We compared sea otter counts conducted from small boats throughout the Sound during the summers of 1984 and 1985 to counts made after the spill during the summer of 1989. We used ratio estimators, corrected for sighting probability, to calculate otter densities and population estimates for portions of the Sound affected by the oil spill. We estimated the otter population in the portion of Prince William Sound affected by the oil was 6,546 at the time of the spill and that the post-spill population in the summer of 1989 was 3,898, yielding a loss estimate of approximately 2,650. Bootstrapping techniques were used to approximate confidence limits on the loss estimate of about 500â€“5,000 otters. The wide confidence limits are a result of the complex scheme required to estimate losses and limitations of the data. Despite the uncertainty of the loss estimate it is clear that a significant fraction of the otters in the spill zone survived. We observed otters persisting in relatively clean embayments throughout the oil spill zone suggesting that the highly convoluted coastline of Prince William Sound produced refuges that allowed some sea otters in the oil spill area to survive.},

Mating occurred year-round. but peaked in September and October. Females first bred at 4 years of age and were capable of pupping annually; they generally separated from their pup before mating. Males established breeding territories that enabled prolonged precopulatory interact ions that may have prompted female - pup separation and postcopulatory interactions that precluded females from mating with other malcs. Male mating success was related to age, weight, territory quality, and the length of time they maintained their territory. After the brceding season, territorial males returned to male areas where food was more abundant. Young. dispersing males also entered male areas and remained there until attaining breeding age. In male areas, otters commonly rested in groups of >50 individuals. Gregariousness promoted social interactions and likely enhanced food finding and (historically) predator protection.

  abstract  = {Sea otters (Enhydra lutris (L.)) were hunted to extinction off the coast of Washington State early in the 20th century. A new population was established by translocations from Alaska in 1969 and 1970. The population, currently numbering at least 550 animals, A major threat to the population is the ongoing risk of majour oil spills in sea otter habitat. We apply population models to census and demographic data in order to evaluate the status of the population. We fit several density dependent models to test for density dependence and determine plausible values for the carrying capacity (K) by comparing model goodness of fit to an exponential model. Model fits were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A significant negative relationship was found between the population growth rate and population size (r2?=?0.27, F?=?5.57, df?=?16, p?K ranged from 612 to 759 with best-fit parameter estimates for the Bevertonâ€“Holt model including 0.26 for r and 612 for K. The latest (2001) population index count (555) puts the population at 87â€“92% of the estimated carrying capacity, above the suggested range for optimum sustainable population (OSP). Elasticity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of proportional changes in vital rates on the population growth rate (?). The elasticity values indicate the population is most sensitive to changes in survival rates (particularly adult survival).},

  Abstract                 = {Many species have strong habitat preferences that directly influence population viability. For successful reintroduction of threatened populations that rely on habitat structures, the correct placement of artificial structures is also important to population persistence. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach to the problem of translocating animals that rely on permanent habitat structures, in which we first use population dynamics data to identify areas of suitable habitat, and then identify optimal configuration for habitat structures. We use data collected from a non-endangered, conspecific population of the endangered riparian woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes riparia) to examine the degree to which the distribution of dens in translocation sites might influence the likelihood that animals persist in their new environment. We characterize the habitats in which dens occur, analyze their spatial clustering, and compare them to temporal changes in population status for sex and age classes. We compare the potential efficacy of translocation efforts using spatial analysis versus solely habitat-based approaches and identify the optimal spatial configuration of dens that should be considered in this translocation effort. We found that patterns of habitat use were positively correlated with overstorey cover, and animal weight was positively correlated with understorey cover. Woodrats appear to select den locations on the basis of understorey cover, but also benefit from dense overstorey cover and distance to nearest tree. Our results suggest that in translocation efforts, artificial dens should be placed in clusters within a radius of 15 m, as values above and below this value showed negative correlations with body mass. Translocations should occur after reproductive events, which occur in April and August for woodrats in southern California. Our analyses provide practical guidelines in determining appropriate timing and spacing for translocation events in the context of animal condition, minimizing disease transmission, and reproduction.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, there are no generally recognized approaches for linking detailed mortality and pathology data to population-level analyses of extinction risk. We used a combination of analytical and simulation-based analyses to examine 20 years of age- and sex-specific mortality data for southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris), and we applied results to project the efficacy of alternative conservation strategies. Population recovery of the southern sea otter has been slow (rate of population increase l = 1.05) compared to other recovering populations (l = 1.17–1.20), and the population declined (l = 0.975) between 1995 and 1999. Age-based Leslie matrices were developed to explore explanations for the slow recovery and recent decline in the southern sea other population. An elasticity analysis was performed to predict effects of proportional changes in stage-specific reproductive or survival rates on the rate of population increase. A life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) was developed to evaluate the impact of changing age- and cause-specific mortality rates on l. The information used to develop these models was derived from death assemblage, pathology, and live population census data to examine the sensitivity of sea otter population growth to different sources of mortality (e.g., disease and starvation, direct human take [fisheries, gun shot, boat strike, oil pollution], mating trauma and intraspecific aggression, shark bites, and unknown). We used resampling simulations to generate random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and drew on these to estimate potential effects of mortality sources on population growth (l). Our analyses suggest management actions that are likely and unlikely to promote recovery of the southern sea otter and more broadly indicate a methodology to better utilize cause-of-death data in conservation decision-making.},

It should be based on a clear set of principles with a sustainable development purpose. Developing MSP can draw selectively on extensive experiences in terrestrial land use planning. A nested approach with appropriate planning activity at different spatial scales is recommended. Defining appropriate management units is important and particular effort will be required where these do not align with ecosystem boundaries. The timeframe for plans is tending to increase from around 10 to 20+ years, but review periods are required which enable a balance between stability and relevance. This article focuses on the key steps in the planning process of developing ecosystem-based MSP. The importance of setting specific objectives, including as a context for the full range of relevant spatial data, and determining priorities is emphasised. It is also suggested that stakeholder engagement, including the way it is undertaken, is critical to different stages of the process.},

  Abstract                 = {The dendritic structure of a river network creates directional dispersal and a hierarchical arrangement of habitats. These two features have important consequences for the ecological dynamics of species living within the network. We apply matrix population models to a stage-structured population in a network of habitat patches connected in a dendritic arrangement. By considering a range of life histories and dispersal patterns, both constant in time and seasonal, we illustrate how spatial structure, directional dispersal, survival, and reproduction interact to determine population growth rate and distribution. We investigate the sensitivity of the asymptotic growth rate to the demographic parameters of the model, the system size, and the connections between the patches. Although some general patterns emerge, we find that a species's modes of reproduction and dispersal are quite important in its response to changes in its life history parameters or in the spatial structure. The framework we use here can be customized to incorporate a wide range of demographic and dispersal scenarios.},

The selected model was a CI forest (an ensemble of CI trees), a machine-learning technique whose discriminatory power (class-by-class area under the curve [AUC] ranged from 0.75 to 0.86) and classification accuracy (72%) surpassed those of the other methods tested.

  Abstract                 = {Several classification systems are used to rank species’ extinction risk. Assessments from two of these, IUCN and NatureServe, are often used to inform prioritisation of conservation resources and management strategies. However, despite their widespread use, they have rarely been compared. No research has assessed rank concordance specifically for mammals, while factors increasing the chance of mismatches between systems have not been investigated. In this study, consistency of IUCN/NatureServe extinction risk categorisation is compared for 409 classified extant American and Canadian mammals. Taxonomic bias in between-system mismatches is then analysed, and common ecological factors associated with mismatches are also identified. There was a significant positive correlation between IUCN and NatureServe ranks, although this was not strong (rs = 0.504). Agreement was good for non-threatened categories: 97% of species classified as non-threatened by one system were classified likewise by the other. However, there was considerable discord in threatened categories, with 40% of species classified as threatened by one system and non-threatened by the other. In 89% of such cases, this was due to higher ranking by NatureServe, suggesting that this system is more conservative. Mismatches were identified for 102 of the 373 species with exact rankings on both systems (27%), and these were biased taxonomically with significantly more mismatches for Cetacea and fewer for Rodentia. Mismatches were more common for species with longer gestation periods, fewer offspring per year, and longer life expectancies (all traits associated with K-strategist species), as well as for species in higher trophic levels. Many mismatched species also had fragmented ranges and/or uncertain data. Recognition that IUCN and NatureServe ranks are not synonymous is essential. Assessments should be viewed as complementary and dual results should be used to inform species management. The need for more detailed population demographic data to improve extinction risk calculations should also be addressed.},

  abstract  = {Spatial ecosystem models, such as OSMOSE, have become integral tools in achieving ecosystem-based management for their ability to thoroughly describe predator–prey dynamics in a spatially explicit context. Distribution maps, which define the initial spatial allocation of functional groups abundance, can have a large effect on the predator–prey dynamics that spatially explicit ecosystem models simulate. Here, we introduce the delta GAM approach we developed to be able to produce distribution maps for an OSMOSE model of the West Florida Shelf (Gulf of Mexico), OSMOSE-WFS. This delta GAM approach predicts the spatial distribution of different life stages of the multiple functional groups represented in OSMOSE-WFS (‘life-stage groups’) at different seasons, over the entire Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf including areas where abundance estimates do not exist, using different research survey datasets and regional environmental and habitat features. Our delta GAM approach consists of fitting two independent models, a binomial GAM and a quasi-Poisson GAM, whose predictions are then combined using the delta method to yield spatial abundance estimates. To validate delta GAMs, bootstraps are used and Spearman's correlation coefficients (Spearman's p’s) between predicted and observed abundance values are estimated and tested to be significantly different from zero. We use pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) to demonstrate our delta GAM approach by predicting the summer distribution of this species over the GOM shelf and the West Florida Shelf. Predictions of the delta GAM reflect existing empirical research related to pink shrimp habitat preferences and predictions of a negative binomial GAM previously designed for the GOM. We find that using a delta rather than a negative binomial GAM saves significant computation time at the expense of a slight reduction in GAM performance. A positive and highly significant Spearman's p between observed and predicted abundance values indicates that our delta GAM can reliably be used to predict pink shrimp spatial distribution. Spearman's p was also positive and highly significant in every life-stage group represented in OSMOSE-WFS and season, though often low. Therefore, delta GAMs fitted for the different life-stage groups and seasons correctly predict qualitative differences between low- and high-abundance areas and are deemed appropriate for generating distribution maps for OSMOSE-WFS. The delta GAM approach we developed is a simple, convenient method to create distribution maps to be fed into spatially explicit ecosystem models, where wide spatial and taxonomic coverage is desired while benefits of high precision estimates are lost at run-time.},

  abstract  = {Habitat suitability maps are commonly created by modeling a species’ environmental niche from occurrences and environmental characteristics. Here, we introduce the hyper-envelope modeling interface (HEMI), providing a new method for creating habitat suitability models using Bezier surfaces to model a species niche in environmental space. HEMI allows modeled surfaces to be visualized and edited in environmental space based on expert knowledge and does not require absence points for model development. The modeled surfaces require relatively few parameters compared to similar modeling approaches and may produce models that better match ecological niche theory. As a case study, we modeled the invasive species tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in the western USA. We compare results from HEMI with those from existing similar modeling approaches (including BioClim, BioMapper, and Maxent). We used synthetic surfaces to create visualizations of the various models in environmental space and used modified area under the curve (AUC) statistic and akaike information criterion (AIC) as measures of model performance. We show that HEMI produced slightly better AUC values, except for Maxent and better AIC values overall. HEMI created a model with only ten parameters while Maxent produced a model with over 100 and BioClim used only eight. Additionally, HEMI allowed visualization and editing of the model in environmental space to develop alternative potential habitat scenarios. The use of Bezier surfaces can provide simple models that match our expectations of biological niche models and, at least in some cases, out-perform more complex approaches.},

These paradigms hinge on the notion that tropical surface waters are too warm and nutrient-depleted to support kelp productivity and survival. We present a synthetic oceanographic and ecophysiological model that accurately identifies all known kelp populations and, by using the same criteria, predicts the existence of >23,500 km2 unexplored submerged (30- to 200-m depth) tropical kelp habitats. Predicted tropical kelp habitats were most probable in regions where bathymetry and upwelling resulted in mixed-layer shoaling above the depth of minimum annual irradiance dose for kelp survival. Using model predictions, we discovered extensive new deep-water Eisenia galapagensis populations in the Galapagos that increased in abundance with increasing depth to >60 m, complete with cold-water flora and fauna of temperate affinities. The predictability of deep-water kelp habitat and the discovery of expansive deep-water GalÃ¡pagos kelp forests validate the extent of deep-water tropical kelp refugia, with potential implications for regional productivity and biodiversity, tropical food web ecology, and understanding of the resilience of tropical marine systems to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) goal is “to restore and maintain healthy salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity” (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2005). In order to achieve this goal, the WSP outlines a number of strategies, including ‘Strategy 1: standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses’, which is the subject of this paper. In the current paper, Fraser Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs) from ‘WSP Action Step 1.1: the identification of conservation units’ are used to update ‘Action Step 1.2: the development of criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to represent biological statuses’, and to address ‘Action Step 1.3: CU status assessment’, for the 22 current CUs and two de novo ‘CUs’. Using a previously developed toolkit for CU status assessment (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), abundance benchmarks (unique to each CU) were estimated for each CU with stock-recruitment data, and trends in abundance upper and lower benchmarks (common across all CUs) were modified to apply to Fraser Sockeye. These benchmarks were used to delineate the three WSP biological status zones (Red, Amber, and Green). Abundance benchmarks were estimated across a range of stock-recruitment models, including the standard Ricker model that assumes constant productivity and other Ricker model forms that assume time varying productivity. Consideration of time varying productivity in the estimation of abundance benchmarks was important since most Fraser Sockeye CUs have exhibited systematic declines in productivity over recent decades (Grant et al. 2011) and extirpation risk can increase when a CUs productivity is linearly decreasing or low (Holt 2009; Holt and Bradford 2011). Abundance benchmarks were also estimated across a range of probability levels to reflect uncertainty in the estimation process. Estimates of a CU’s spawner abundances at maximum juvenile production (Smax) were also updated and used as carrying capacity priors in Ricker models, where available and appropriate. In the evaluation of status using the abundance metric, both the geometric and arithmetic means of the recent CU abundance were compared against benchmarks. Since multiple metrics (one abundance and three trends in abundance metrics, depending on the CU) and uncertainty in abundance benchmarks are presented in the current paper, statuses for a single CU can comprise all three WSP status zones. Status integration will be explored in future processes and publications.},

The highest species diversity occurs in the Indonesian archipelago and decreases radially from there. The terrestrial pattern of increasing diversity from poles to tropics occurs from the Arctic to the tropics but does not seem to occur in the southern hemisphere where diversity is high at high latitides. Losses of marine diversity are highest in coastal areas largely as a result of conflicting uses of coastal habitats. The best way to conserve marine diversity is to conserve habitat and landscape diversity in the coastal area. Marine protected areas are only a part of the conservation strategy needed. It is suggested that a framework for coastal conservation is integrated coastal area management where one of the primary goals is sustainable use of coastal biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The evidence for the wider effects of fishing on the marine ecosystem demands that we incorporate these considerations into our management of human activities. The consequences of the direct physical disturbance of the seabed caused by towed bottom-fishing gear have been studied extensively with over 100 manipulations reported in the peer-reviewed literature. The outcome of these studies varies according to the gear used and the habitat in which it was deployed. This variability in the response of different benthic systems concurs with established theoretical models of the response of community metrics to disturbance. Despite this powerful evidence, a recent FAO report wrongly concludes that the variability in the reported responses to fishing disturbance mean that no firm conclusion as to the effects of fishing disturbance can be made. This thesis is further supported (incorrectly) by the supposition that current benthic sampling methodologies are inadequate to demonstrate the effects of fishing disturbance on benthic systems. The present article addresses these two erroneous conclusions which may confuse non-experts and in particular policy-makers.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The shallow, coastal regions of the world's oceans are highly productive ecosystems providing important habitat for commercial, forage, endangered, and iconic species. Given the diversity of ecosystem services produced or supported by this ecosystem, a better understanding of its structure and function is central to developing an ecosystem-based approach to management. However this region â€“ termed the "white strip" by marine geologists because of the general lack of high-resolution bathymetric data is dynamic, highly variable, and difficult to access making data collection challenging and expensive. Since substrate is a key indicator of habitat in this important ecosystem, our objective was to create a continuous substrate map from the best available bottom type data. Such data are critical to assessments of species distributions and anthropogenic risk. Using the Strait of Georgia in coastal British Columbia, Canada, as a case study, we demonstrate how such a map can be created from a diversity of sources. Our approach is simple, quantitative, and transparent making it amenable to iterative improvement as data quality and availability improve. We evaluated the ecological performance of our bottom patches using observed shellfish distributions. We found that observations of geoduck clam, an infaunal species, and red urchins, a species preferentially associated with hard bottom, were strongly and significantly associated with our soft and hard patches respectively. Our description of bottom patches also corresponded well with a more traditional, morphological classification of a portion of the study area. To provide subsequent analyses (such as habitat models) with some confidence in the defined bottom type values, we developed a corresponding confidence surface based on the agreement of, and distance between observations. Our continuous map of nearshore bottom patches thus provides a spatial framework to which other types of data, both abiotic (e.g., energy) and biotic, can be attached. As more data are associated with the bottom patches, we anticipate they will become increasingly useful for representing and developing species-habitat relationships, ultimately leading to a comprehensive representation of the nearshore ecosystem.},

  abstract  = {We estimated carrying capacity for sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada, by characterizing habitat according to the complexity of nearshore intertidal and sub-tidal contours. We modeled the total area of complex habitat on the west coast of Vancouver Island by first calculating the complexity of the Checleset Bay-Kyuquot Sound (CB-KS) region, where sea otters have been at equilibrium since the mid-1990s. We then identified similarly complex areas on the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI model), and adapted the model to identify areas of similar complexity along the entire British Columbia coast (BC model). Using survey data from the CB-KS region, we calculated otter densities for the habitat predicted by the 2 models. The density estimates for CB-KS were 3.93 otters/km2 and 2.53 otters/km2 for the WCVI and BC models, respectively, and the resulting 2 estimates of west coast of Vancouver Island complex habitat carrying capacity were not significantly different (WCVI model: 5,123, 95% CI = 3,337--7,104; BC model: 4,883, 95% CI = 3,223--6,832). The BC model identified the region presently occupied by otters on the central British Columbia coast, but the amount of coast-wide habitat it predicted (5,862 km2) was relatively small, and the associated carrying capacity estimate (14,831, 95% CI = 9,790--20,751) was low compared to historical accounts. We suggest that our model captured a type of high-quality or optimum habitat prevalent on the west coast of Vancouver Island, typified by the CB-KS region, and that suitable sea otter habitat elsewhere on the coast must include other habitat characteristics. We therefore calculated a linear, coast-wide carrying capacity of 52,459 sea otters (95% CI = 34,264--73,489)---a more realistic upper limit to sea otters in British Columbia. Our carrying capacity estimates are helping set population recovery targets for sea otters in Canada, and our habitat predictions represent a first step in Critical Habitat identification. This habitat-based approach to estimating carrying capacity is likely suitable for other nonmigratory, density-dependent species.},

  Abstract                 = {We used published information about foraging behaviour, terrestrial resting sites, bathymetry and seasonal ocean climate to develop hypotheses relating life-history traits and physical variables to the at-sea habitat of a wide-ranging marine predator, the Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus. We used these hypotheses to develop a series of habitat models predicting the probability of sea lions occurring within a 3 × 3 km2 grid in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We compared these deductive model predictions with opportunistic at-sea observations of sea lions (presence-only data) using (1) a likelihood approach in a small area where effort was assumed to be uniformly distributed and (2) an adjusted skewness (Skadj) test that evaluated the distribution of the predicted values associated with true presence observations. We found that the Skadj statistic was comparable to the likelihood test when using pseudo-absence data, but it was more powerful for assessing the relative performance of the different predictive spatial models across the entire study area. The habitat maps we produced for adult female sea lions using the deductive modelling approach captured a higher proportion of presence observations than the current habitat model (critical habitat) used by fisheries managers since 1993 to manage Steller sea lions. Such improved predictions of habitat are necessary to effectively design, implement and evaluate fishery mitigation measures. The deductive approach we propose is suitable for modelling the habitat use of other age and sex classes, and for integrating these age/sex-class-specific models into a revised definition of critical habitat for Steller sea lions. The skewness test provides a means of comparing the relative performance of such models, using presence-only data. The approach can be readily applied to other central-place foragers.},

We used local spatial statistics and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to determine the spatial pattern of malaria incidence and persistence in northeastern Venezuela. Seven to 11 hot spots of malaria transmission were detected by using local spatial statistics, although disease persistence was explained only for four of those hot spots. The GWR models greatly improved predictions of malaria risk compared with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Malaria incidence was largely explained by the proximity to and number of Anopheles aquasalis habitats nearby (1--3 km), and low-elevation terrains. Disease persistence was associated with greater human population density, lower elevations, and proximity to aquatic habitats. However, there was significant local spatial variation in the relationship between malaria and environmental variables. Spatial modeling improves the understanding of the causal factors operating at several scales in the transmission of malaria.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysing the persistence and viability of small populations is a key issue in extinction theory and population viability analysis. However, there is still no consensus on how to quantify persistence and viability. We present an approach to evaluate any simulation model concerned with extinction. The approach is devised from general Markov models of stochastic population dynamics. From these models, we distil insights into the general mathematical structure of the risk of extinction by time t, P0(t). From this mathematical structure, we devise a simple but effective protocol -- the ln(1 - P0)-plot -- which is applicable for situations including environmental noise or catastrophes. This plot delivers two quantities which are fundamental to the assessment of persistence and viability: the intrinsic mean time to extinction, Tm, and the probability c1 of the population reaching the established phase. The established phase is characterized by typical fluctuations of the population's state variable which can be described by quasi-stationary probability distributions. The risk of extinction in the established phase is constant and given by 1/Tm. We show that Tm is the basic currency for the assessment of persistence and viability because Tm is independent of initial conditions and allows the risk of extinction to be calculated for any time horizon. For situations where initial conditions are important, additionally c1 has to be considered.},

However, reliability and equitability may be compromised when harvesters benefit economically from under- reported releases. For example, harvesters in the British Columbia offshore groundfish trawl benefit from under-reported marketable released sablefish and dead released halibut. When monitoring programmes provide essential data for management, a review of the programme’s veracity is required.
In this analysis, releases are predicted using environmental, social and economic pre- dictors, and then compared with reported releases. Compared to the average individual, some observers report more- or less-than-expected releases, and some skippers have more- or less-than-expected releases deducted from quota. However, these weights appear to be negligible for both species. The analysis does not provide strong reasons to suspect that release data are unreliable or inequitable for their intended purpose.},

The area of study is restricted to the North Sea, however, the final conclusions have a far wider application. Protests against the use of trawls date back to the period of their introduction; for northwest Europe this was the thirteenth century, and it still evokes protests up to the present day. Trawling does affect benthic life, the trawl penetrates up to 30 mm into the soil, depending on the substrate. All types of trawls are basically similar in their action on the bed. Beam trawls with tickler chains catch much more benthos than do ground trawls without tickler chains. Some groups of animals suffer far more damage than others, e.g. echinoderms. It is not unlikely that in the long-term a shift in species and numbers may occur along the same lines such as has been found in the German Wadden Sea where polychaetes are on the incline and molluscs and crustaceans on the decline.},

  abstract  = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the speciesâ€™ response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

  abstract  = {Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), an anadromous smelt in the Northeast Pacific Ocean was examined for listing under the USA's Endangered Species Act (ESA). A southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of eulachon that occurs in the California Current and is composed of numerous subpopulations that spawn in rivers from northern California to northern British Columbia was identified on the basis of ecological and environmental characteristics, and to a lesser extent, genetic and life history variation. Although the northern terrestrial boundary of this DPS remains uncertain, our consensus opinion was that this northern boundary occurs south of the Nass River and that the DPS was discrete from more northern eulachon, as well as significant to the biological species as a whole and thus is a 'species' under the ESA. Eulachon have been nearly absent in northern California for over two decades, have declined in the Fraser River by over 97% in the past 10 years, and are at historically low levels in other British Columbia rivers in the DPS, and nearly so in the Columbia River. Major threats to southern eulachon include climate change impacts on ocean and freshwater habitat, by-catch in offshore shrimp trawl fisheries, changes in downstream flow timing and intensity owing to dams and water diversions, and predation. These threats, together with large declines in abundance, indicate that the southern DPS of eulachon is at moderate risk of extinction throughout all of its range. The southern DPS was listed as threatened under the ESA in May 2010 â€“ the first marine forage fish to be afforded these statutory protections, which apply only to waters under U.S. jurisdiction.},

  abstract  = {Extensive range shift and mass extinctions resulting from climate change are predicted to impact all biodiversity on the basis of species distribution models of wide-spread and data-rich taxa (i.e. vascular plants, terrestrial invertebrates, birds). Cases that both support and contradict these predictions have been observed in empirical and modelling investigations that continue to under-represent small mammal species (Introduction). Given small mammals are primary or higher order consumers and often dispersal limited, incorporating resource gradients that define the fundamental niche may be vital for generating accurate estimates of range shift. This idea was investigated through the influence of coarse to fine resolution, landscape- and quadrat-scale data on the range dynamics of four temperate and five arid-zone small mammals. This investigation determined: i. Landscape-scale edaphic and biotic factors improved model fit, robustness and transferability for five species, especially arid species, via improved discrimination of unsuitable habitat (specificity) or suitable habitat for a wet-heath specialist (Rattus lutreolus lutreolus; Chapters 1 & 4). ii. Quadrat-scale biotic factors improved model fit for three species; a dense understorey preferring species (Isoodon obesulus obesulus), granivore (Notomys cervinus) and insectivore (Sminthopsis macroura; Chapters 2 & 4), iii. Coarse or fine resolution environmental data were more strongly correlated with the occurrence of different species across variables, reflecting the known ecology of these species (Chapters 2 & 4), and iv. Fine resolution environmental data directly affected the spatial representation of available habitat in a coupled niche-population model, resulting in smaller shifts being detected for a greater number of species (Chapter 3). Biotic interactions can drive adaptations that can lead to species becoming dependent on resource availability for survival or reproduction (Chapter 5). Complex ecosystem dynamics can make it difficult to distinguish resource partitioning caused by specialist adaptations (fundamental niche) from contemporary interactions (realised niche). In this investigation, evidence of biotic environmental variables defining the fundamental niche was provided by improved model transferability: representing direct (e.g. suitable habitat - R. l. lutreolus) or indirect influences on species’ occurrence (e.g. rainfall via food availability on I. o. obesulus, N. cervinus and Dasyuroides byrnei). In addition to better representing resources, fine-scale environmental data affected the spatial configuration of available habitat, leading to smaller estimates of range shift. Hence, it is vital to consider species-environment relationships and conceptualise direct or proximal variables in order to construct robust SDMs. Improving this practice will also identify key relationships that influence community dynamics and require further empirical research (Chapter 5).},

  Abstract                 = {The region known as the central coast of British Columbia (Canada) extends from northern Vancouver Island (approximately 50ºN) to the Queen Charlotte Islands (approximately 53ºN). It encompasses the broad, fjord-strewn mainland region, the open waters of Queen Charlotte Sound, the passages of Queen Charlotte Strait, Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage, numerous island archipelagos, and offshore waters. The central coast boasts abundant natural resources, stunning land and seascapes, and diverse ecosystems. In comparison to other locations in BC, and indeed the world, the central coast is a relatively pristine environment, at least with respect to environmental contamination. Despite spanning approximately half of British Columbia’s coastline, the region is home to only 55,000 residents, or 1.4% of British Columbia’s total. This low population density largely explains the relatively pristine nature of the central coast. Nonetheless, pollution and contamination concerns do exist in the central coast. Sources of contamination comprise local, regional and global scales, with timeframes for contaminant impacts varying from short to long-term. Past and ongoing activities which have impacted the environment in the central coast include contamination sources associated with salmon aquaculture, oil pollution, wastewater effluent, marine traffic (shipping, boating and cruise ships), forestry and forest products, and mining, as well as the global atmospheric transport and deposition of “legacy” Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), “new” POPs, and metals. Regulations implemented to eliminate the use of many of the POPs, as well as regulations designed to reduce the by-production of dioxins and furans through pulp processes and wood preservative applications, have helped to reduce the inputs of harmful substances into the coastal waters of the central coast. However, emerging issues are likely to reflect new industrial chemicals and pesticides, increasing cruise ship traffic, the expansion of aquaculture activities, and perhaps most significantly, the potential for the development of offshore oil and gas in the Queen Charlotte Basin. This report will provide the reader with an annotated summary of information sources on what is known about this coastal region of British Columbia. However, significant information gaps exist on basic biology and ecology of the species present in this area, making it difficult to conduct a thorough assessment of the state of the environment in the central coast. Basic and applied research is clearly needed to address some of the fundamental information gaps needed for effective management and conservation in this region.},

It provides several methodologies for calculating the total catch of IRF species by the hook and line fisheries: (i) the adjustment of landed IRF catch using observed discard rates, (ii) the prediction of total IRF catch from landed target catch, and (iii) the extrapolation of observed catch to total catch, with estimates of precision from simple random sampling theory. While the latter methodology is sound in principle, the limited availability of data and the low levels of observer coverage lead to highly biased estimates of total catch with enormous confidence intervals. Levels of observer coverage needed to attain target precision levels are derived based on the available set of observer logs. Because the current low levels of coverage are insufficient to characterize the underlying fisheries, estimates of catch and coverage derived should not be used for management purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {Expanding habitat protection is a common tactic for species conservation. When unprotected habitat is privately owned, decisions must be made about which areas to protect by land purchase or conservation easement. To address this problem, we developed an optimization framework for choosing the habitat-protection strategy that minimizes the risk of population extinction subject to an upper bound on funding. The framework is based on the idea that an extinction-risk function that predicts the relative effects of varying the quantity and quality of habitat can be estimated from the results of a demographic model of population viability. We used the framework to address the problem of expanding the protected habitat of a core population of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) in the Panoche area in central California. We first developed a stochastic demographic model of the kit fox population. Predictions from the simulation model were used to estimate an extinction-risk function that depended on areas of good- and fair-quality habitat. The risk function was combined with costs of habitat protection to determine cost-efficient protection strategies and risk-cost curves showing how extinction risk could be reduced at minimum cost for increasing levels of funding. One important result was that cost-efficient shares of the budget used to protect different types of habitat changed as the budget increased and depended on the relative costs of available habitat and the relative effects of habitat protection on extinction risk. Another important finding was the sensitivity of the location and slope of the risk-cost curve to assumptions about the spatial configuration of available habitat. When the location and slope of the risk-cost curve are sensitive to model assumptions, resulting predictions of extinction risk and risk reduction per unit cost should be used very cautiously in ranking conservation options among different species or populations. The application is an example of how the results of a complex demographic model of population viability can be synthesized for use in optimization analyses to determine cost-efficient habitat-protection strategies and risk-cost tradeoffs.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The effects of physical disturbance processes on marine benthic communities remain an issue of considerable theoretical and practical importance, particularly with respect to the impact of fisheries activity and possible conflict with wildlife conservation objectives. One area where particular concern has been raised is with respect to the effects of mechanical harvesting of cockles (Cerastoderma edule) on non-target benthic infauna in intertidal communities. 
2. This paper describes the results of manipulative field experiments which examine the effects of disturbance by two mechanical cockle harvesting methods, hydraulic suction dredging and tractor dredging.
3. Although the suction dredge experiment revealed some statistically significant effects, taken as a whole the results indicated that the faunal structure in disturbed plots recovered (i.e. approached that of the un-disturbed controls) by 56 days. This occurred against a background of consistent increases in the abundance of many taxa in both treatments, which we interpret as the normal seasonal response of the community.
4. The tractor dredge experiment revealed fewer statistically significant effects than the suction dredge experiment, and recovery from disturbance occurred against a background of general seasonal decline in the abundance of the fauna. From the available evidence the most likely mechanism of recovery was through the immigration of adults into disturbed areas.
5. We conclude that mechanical harvesting methods impose high levels of mortality on nontarget benthic fauna, but that recovery of disturbed sites is rapid and the overall effects on populations is probably low. Although our results suggest that tractor dredging has less effect than suction dredging, this result is most likely to be a consequence of the different times of year in which the experiments were conducted. Thus, for this location, we do not believe that a distinction can be made between the effects of the two methods. Although experimental manipulations cannot be conducted on comparable spatial scales to real fishing activity, we believe these results probably do not represent a major under-estimate of recovery times for intertidal habitats similar to the one chosen for this study.},

  Abstract                 = {There appears to be considerable potential for further reduction in global by-catch. This reduction is most likely to be achieved by focusing even greater attention on the technical, regulatory and social approaches that are currently practiced. With respect to the technical approaches, meta-analysis indicates that overall reductions in by- catch of between 25% and 64% could be achieved if global fishing fleets could match somewhere between the minimum and median performance of gear modifications used in experimental studies. If such benefits are to be delivered, however, engaging fishers more comprehensively in solving the problems will be essential. Further developing legislative and institutional arrangements will also assist. However, notwithstanding the potential gains that can be achieved, it must be recognized that careful analysis will often be required to ensure that a proposed measure will achieve the desired objective at an acceptable cost.},

  Abstract                 = {Landings statistics can be lower than true catches because many fish are discarded or landed illegally. Since many discards do not survive, treating landings as true catches can lead to biased stock assessments. This paper proposes treating catch as censored by bounding it below by the landings, L, and above by cL (for scalar c > 1). We demonstrate the approach with a simulation study, using a Schaefer surplus production model. Parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework with BUGS software using two sets of priors. Both the traditional true-catch method and a survey-and-effort method (which was landings free) performed worse on average than the censored approach, as measured by the Bayes risk associated with estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and of an index of depletion (X). Recursive partitioning (regression trees) was used to associate simulation parameters to best-performing methods, showing that higher commercial fish catchability favoured the censored method at estimating X. In conclusion, censored methods provide a means of dealing with discarding and misreporting that can outperform some traditional alternatives.},

  abstract    = {Investigations have been underway since 1998 to fill some of the knowledge gaps in the giant red sea cucumber fishery that were originally identified in 1996. The current regime of annual harvest conducted in only 25% of the British Columbia coast, along with experimental fishing, have allowed a thorough study of the effects of harvesting on the density and size of sea cucumbers.
Surveys were conducted in six commercially-open harvesting areas; all had a decline in density ranging from 10% to 23% between 1998 and 2007. There was a decline in the mean weight of sea cucumbers in four of the six open areas ranging from 12% to 17%.
Four experimental fishery areas (EFAs) were developed to study the effects of various harvest levels on density and sea cucumber size. Five sites (no harvest, 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16% harvest rate) were established in each EFA and were harvested annually, based on virgin population estimated at the beginning of the study. The sites with higher harvest rates, 8% and 16%, showed large decreases in density between the first and last year of study. Lower harvest rates (control, 2% and 4%) did not show the same levels of decline. The mean weight of sea cucumbers also declined during this time period, significantly in approximately half of the 20 EFA sites and by up to 37%. The declines in mean split weight were not entirely the result of harvesting levels, as size also declined in control sites.
A latent productivity model was used to estimate the maximum sustainable harvest rate, using the 10 years of data from the experimental fishery areas. Maximum sustainable harvest rates, at the 1 percentile level (i.e. 99% confident that the true harvest rate is higher), ranged between 3.5% and 10.3% of estimated virgin biomass over the four EFAs. In no EFA was the 16% harvest rate found to be sustainable.
A total of 7.7% of the shoreline available for fishing was targeted by harvesters in 2005. The fleet does not target the same pieces of shoreline repeatedly and they appear to harvest different areas from year to year. As was expected, the amount of shoreline targeted by harvesters increased with quota levels, but natural reserves with high densities of sea cucumbers persisted.
Results from these Phase-1 fishery investigations form the basis of recommendations to resource managers to expand the sea cucumber fishery to other areas of the BC coast using a conservative annual harvest rate ranging from 3.5% to 10.3% of virgin biomass. A limit reference point (LRP) of 50% virgin biomass is recommended, and an upper stock reference point (USR) of 60% to 80% virgin biomass is suggested. It is further recommended that the experimental fisheries be continued as they are a valuable tool for monitoring population response to fishing, and that no-harvest reserves be established in fishing areas for comparative monitoring.},

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II. Ignoring time delays in population and metapopulation dynamics will lead to an underestimate of the number of effectively endangered species.
Resumen: Para permitir la persistencia de una metapoblaciÃ³n a largo plazo, una red de fragmentos de hÃ¡bitat debe satisfacer ciertas condiciones en cuanto a nÃºmero, tamaÃ±o y configuraciÃ³n espacial de los fragmentos. La influencia de la estructura del paisaje en las condiciones del umbral puede ser medida por una cantidad llamada capacidad de la metapoblaciÃ³n, la cual puede ser calculada para paisajes reales fragmentados. La pÃ©rdida de hÃ¡bitat y la fragmentaciÃ³n reducen la capacidad metapoblacional de un paisaje y hacen menos probable que se puedan reunir las condiciones de umbral. Si las condiciones no son alcanzadas, se espera que la metapoblaciÃ³n se extinga, pero tomarÃ¡ algÃºn tiempo despuÃ©s de la pÃ©rdida del hÃ¡bitat para que la extinciÃ³n ocurra, lo cual genera una deuda de extinciÃ³n en una comunidad de especies. Mostramos que una deuda de extinciÃ³n es especialmente grande en una comunidad en la cual muchas especies estÃ¡n cercanas a su umbral de extinciÃ³n despuÃ©s de ocurrir una pÃ©rdida de hÃ¡bitat debido a que el tiempo de retraso en la dinÃ¡mica metapoblacional es especialmente largo en estas especies. Una consecuencia es que se espera que los paisajes que han experimentado recientemente una pÃ©rdida sustancial de hÃ¡bitat y fragmentaciÃ³n muestren un exceso transitorio de especies raras, lo cual representa una indicaciÃ³n de la deuda de extinciÃ³n que anteriormente se habÃ­a pasado por alto. Consideramos un ejemplo putativo de deuda de extinciÃ³n en los escarabajos que habitan los bosques de Finlandia. Actualmente, hay igualmente pocos bosques naturales a lo largo de sur de Finlandia, pero el nÃºmero de escarabajos de bosques maduros regionalmente extintos es mucho mayor en las Ã¡reas costeras del Suroeste, las que presentan un impacto humano mÃ¡s fuerte en los bosques, que en las Ã¡reas interiores del noreste, con una actividad forestal intensa iniciada solo despuÃ©s de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. El ignorar el historial de las dinÃ¡micas poblacionales y metapoblacionales resultarÃ¡ en una pobre estimaciÃ³n de un nÃºmero de especies realmente en peligro.},

  Abstract                 = {Mechanism-based ecological models are a valuable tool for understanding the drivers of complex ecological systems and for making informed resource-management decisions. However, inaccurate conclusions can be drawn from models with a large degree of uncertainty around multiple parameter estimates if uncertainty is ignored. This is especially true in non-linear systems with multiple interacting variables. We addressed these issues for a mechanism-based, demographic model of Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), the dominant riparian tree species along southwestern U.S. rivers. Many cottonwood populations have declined following widespread floodplain conversion and flow regulation, and accurate predictive models are needed to analyze effects of future climate change and water management decisions. To quantify effects of parameter uncertainty we developed an analytical approach combining global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with classification and regression trees (CART) and Random Forest, a bootstrapping CART method. We used GSA to quantify the interacting effects of the full range of uncertainty around all parameter estimates, Random Forest to rank parameters according to their total effect on model predictions, and CART to identify higher-order interactions. GSA simulations yielded a wide range of predictions, including annual germination frequency of 10 - 100%, annual first-year survival frequency of 0 - 50%, and patch occupancy of 0 - 100%. This variance was explained primarily by complex interactions among abiotic parameters including capillary fringe height, stage-discharge relationship, and floodplain accretion rate, which interacted with biotic factors to affect survival. Model precision was primarily influenced by well-studied parameter estimates with minimal associated uncertainty, and was virtually unaffected by parameter estimates for which there are no available empirical data and thus a large degree of uncertainty. Therefore, research to improve model predictions should not always focus on the least-studied parameters, but rather those to which model predictions are most sensitive. We advocate the combined use of global sensitivity analysis, CART and Random Forest to: 1) prioritize research efforts by ranking variable importance; 2) efficiently improve models by focusing on the most important parameters and; 3) illuminate complex model properties including non-linear interactions. We present an analytical framework that can be applied to any model with multiple uncertain parameter estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {Fishery by-catch, especially discarded by-catch, is a serious problem in the world's oceans. Not only are the stocks of discarded species affected, but entire trophic webs and habitats may be disrupted at the ecosystem level. This paper reviews discarding in the marine fisheries of the USA; however, the type, diversity and regulatory mechanisms of the fisheries are similar to developed fisheries and management programmes throughout the world. We have compiled current estimates of discarded by-catch for each major marine fishery in the USA using estimates from existing literature, both published and unpublished. We did not re-estimate discards or discard rates from raw data, nor did we include data on protected species (turtles, mammals and birds) and so this study covers discarded by-catch of finfish and fishable invertebrates. For some fisheries, additional calculations were required to transform number data into weight data, and typically length and weight composition data were used. Specific data for each fishery are referenced in Harrington etÂ al. (Wasted Resources: Bycatch and discards in US Fisheries, Oceana, Washington, DC, 2005). Overall, our compiled estimates are that 1.06Â million tonnes of fish were discarded and 3.7Â million tonnes of fish were landed in USA marine fisheries in 2002. This amounts to a nationwide discard to landings ratio of 0.28, amongst the highest in the world. Regionally, the southeast had the largest discard to landings ratio (0.59), followed closely by the highly migratory species fisheries (0.52) and the northeast fisheries (0.49). The Alaskan and west coast fisheries had the lowest ratios (0.12 and 0.15 respectively). Shrimp fisheries in the southeast were the major contributors to the high discard rate in that region, with discard ratios of 4.56 (Gulf of Mexico) and 2.95 (South Atlantic). By-catch and discarding is a major component of the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems. There have been substantial efforts to reduce by-catch in some fisheries, but broadly based programmes covering all fisheries are needed within the USA and around the world. In response to international agreements to improve fishery management, by-catch and discard reduction must become a regular part of fishery management planning.},

  Abstract                 = {Remotely-operated vehicle surveys of inshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) are low-cost and non-lethal, but frequently result in density estimates with high variance. Adaptive cluster sampling may result in more precise abundance estimates when the distribution of organisms is rare and clustered. Using computer simulations, I investigate the ability of adaptive cluster sampling to reduce sampling variance for remotely-operated vehicle surveys of rockfish. In general, adaptive cluster sampling was less precise than simple random sampling in surveys of equivalent sampling effort. Adaptive cluster sampling was only more precise (for equivalent sample size) for highly clustered rockfish populations, large initial sample sizes, and small numbers of adaptively sampled units, conditions which are not likely met for ROV surveys of rockfish, based on my analyses. Adaptive cluster sampling is not recommended for remotely operated vehicle surveys of rockfish and other strategies should be investigated to increase the precision of abundance estimates.},

Risk assessment combined with decision analysis provides a methodology for quantifying these uncertainties and a framework for making management decisions in an uncertain world. In the last decade they have been applied widely in economics, epidemiology and fisheries management. Their potential use in conservation biology is reviewed here using two examples: population viability analysis and the reduction of the by-catch of small cetaceans in fishing gear.},

  abstract    = {In this paper recommendations are provided for defining critical habitat for stickleback species pairs in British Columbia, based on a weight of evidence approach. Recommendations are made for the proportion of existing habitat that can be considered critical, but no effort has yet gone into delineating specific areas in the wild. Critical habitat recommendations were developed using the framework suggested in Rosenfeld and Hatfield (2006). Population targets are explored and supported using multiple approaches, including simple population viability analyses, rules of thumb, and genetic considerations. Simple population viability analyses indicate that stickleback are resilient to environmental stochasticity even when populations are at low abundance. I used two quasi-extinction thresholds, based on environmental and genetic considerations. Population models could be improved considerably with additional information on stickleback vital rates, but population-specific data are unlikely to be available soon. Habitat required to meet proposed population targets varied from 5% to 100% of existing habitat depending on the modeling approach.
There are two key components of habitat for benthic-limnetic and lake-stream species pairs: 1) habitat features that control the abundance of limnetics and benthics (i.e., population size), and 2) features of the environment that ensure proper mate recognition and assortative mating. Therefore, habitat needs for species pairs include features whose alteration or loss will lead to reduction in abundance to an unviable population level, or breakdown of reproductive barriers sufficient to cause collapse into a hybrid swarm. These habitat features are reviewed briefly here.
Most defensible approaches indicate that a considerable portion of existing habitat is critical, and the dependence of species pair co-existence on reproductive isolation indicates that the habitat attributes required for persistence must be maintained at the ecosystem scale, i.e. that in each case the entire lake plus a riparian buffer should be designated as critical habitat. Recommended critical habitat for benthic-limnetic pairs includes the entire lake for each pair and a riparian buffer of 15 to 30 m width surrounding the wetted perimeter of each species pair lake and all ephemeral and perennial streams flowing into the lakes. 
Recommended critical habitat for the Misty Lake pair includes the entire lake, the wetted area of the entire inlet stream, and the wetted area of the outlet stream as far downstream as the lower limit of currently occupied habitat (presently estimated at 2.3 km downstream of the lake). Also included as critical for the Misty Pair is a riparian buffer of 15 to 30 m width on the lake and both inlet and outlet streams, plus any perennial or ephemeral tributaries.},

We developed a predictive, vegetation-based model for habitat of the species in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, using logistic-regression modeling techniques and analyzed seven habitat variables with six of the variables included in the final model. A plot analysis using Receiver Operating Characteristics indicated a high performance of the model, and validation of the model confirmed proper function. Compared with random unoccupied sites, the model indicates that owls in the Jemez Mountains prefer habitat with greater diversity, density, and height of trees, canopy cover, and shrub density, which is in agreement with much of the literature on biology of the Mexican spotted owl. This model can be used with fine-scale assessments of habitat for land-management agencies that have a priority to accurately delineate habitat of the Mexican spotted owl. Los Alamos National Laboratory will use this model to re-delineate habitat of owls to reduce assessment costs and to better protect appropriate habitat.},

  abstract  = {Bottom trawl survey data are commonly used as a sampling technique to assess the spatial distribution of commercial species. However, this sampling technique does not always correctly detect a species even when it is present, and this can create significant limitations when fitting species distribution models. In this study, we aim to test the relevance of a mixed methodological approach that combines presence-only and presence-absence distribution models. We illustrate this approach using bottom trawl survey data to model the spatial distributions of 27 commercially targeted marine species. We use an environmentally- and geographically-weighted method to simulate pseudo-absence data. The species distributions are modelled using regression kriging, a technique that explicitly incorporates spatial dependence into predictions. Model outputs are then used to identify areas that met the conservation targets for the deployment of artificial anti-trawling reefs. To achieve this, we propose the use of a fuzzy logic framework that accounts for the uncertainty associated with different model predictions. For each species, the predictive accuracy of the model is classified as ‘high’. A better result is observed when a large number of occurrences are used to develop the model. The map resulting from the fuzzy overlay shows that three main areas have a high level of agreement with the conservation criteria. These results align with expert opinion, confirming the relevance of the proposed methodology in this study.},

This manuscript provides a broad overview of the activities undertaken and data collected. Two thousand three hundred and seventy-two different nominal species were sampled by the trawl and sled, only 728 by both gears. The towed video was not able to provide the same level of taxonomic resolution of epibenthic taxa, but was particularly useful in areas where the seabed was too rough to be sampled. Data from the trawl, sled and video were combined to characterise the epibenthic assemblages of the region. Data from the towed video was also used to provide a characterisation of the inter-reefal benthic habitats, which was then analysed in combination with physical covariate data to examine relationships between the two. Levels of mud and gravel in the sediments, trawling effort and seabed current stress were the covariates most significantly correlated with the nature of the seabed habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical advances in systematic reserve design aim to promote the efficient use of limited conservation resources and to increase the likelihood that reserve networks enhance the persistence of valued species and ecosystems. However, these methods have rarely been applied to species that rely on spatially disjunct habitats. We used the marbled murrelet, a seabird that requires old-growth forest in which to nest and high quality marine habitats in which to forage, as a case study to explore methods of incorporating multiple ecological values into single species spatial reserve design. Specifically, we used the cost function in MARXAN to include the ecological value of marine habitats while identifying spatial solutions for terrestrial nesting habitat reserves. Including marine values influenced terrestrial reserve designs most when terrestrial habitat targets were low and little or none of the target was represented in pre-existing protected areas. Our results suggest that including marine values in the planning process will influence marbled murrelet terrestrial reserve designs most where substantial terrestrial nesting habitat still exists, where new reserves are relatively unconstrained by pre-existing reserves, or when conservation resources only allow the protection of a small fraction of available habitat. This paper presents a novel framework for incorporating multiple measures of ecological value in the spatial reserve design process and should be particularly useful for species that rely on multiple habitats during their life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between ecological processes operating at different scales are critical aspects of habitat suitability requiring careful consideration in conservation planning. Our previous research indicated that local abundance and demographics of subpopulations of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus (L., 1758)), structured in 11 river canyons in northern Labrador, were influenced by predation risk from nest-site-limited raptors. At demographic extremes, where raptors were absent, Harlequin Ducks were stable at high densities, with positive-projected growth, suggesting that they were at carrying capacity and a source of emigrants. In contrast, where raptors were abundant, low density, highly variable populations of ducks approached local extinction in some years, with subsequent increases suggestive of immigration rescue effects. A comparison of resources for Harlequin Ducks indicated no differences in habitat availability among these putative “source” and “sink” subpopulations. In the present study, we used multivariate analysis to identify habitat characteristics important for home-range use within these river canyons and to develop habitat suitability indices (HSI). Despite similar habitat availability, different characteristics were locally important. In a sink where predation risk was high, only danger-reducing habitat characteristics (i.e., overhang vegetation) were identified as important, whereas invertebrates was a predominant characteristic of the source HSI. Despite similar habitat availability, HSI developed in source and sink habitats would, respectively, over- and under-estimate regional habitat availability. Informed conservation and management strategies will therefore require integrating individual trade-offs about predation risk and resources into a multiscale context.},

  abstract  = {Presence-only data can be used to determine resource selection and estimate a species’ distribution. Maximum likelihood is a common parameter estimation method used for species distribution models. Maximum likelihood estimates, however, do not always exist for a commonly used species distribution model – the Poisson point process.
We demonstrate the issue with conventional maximum likelihood mathematically, using a data example, and a simulation experiment and show alternative estimation methods.
We found that when habitat preferences are strong or the number of presence-only locations is small, by chance, maximum likelihood coefficient estimates for the Poisson point process model may not exist. We found that several alternative estimation methods can produce reliable estimates, but results will depend on the chosen method.
It is important to identify conditions for which maximum likelihood estimates are unlikely to be identifiable from presence-only data. In data sets where the maximum likelihood estimates do not exist, penalized likelihood and Bayesian methods will produce coefficient estimates, but these are sensitive to the choice of estimation procedure and prior or penalty term. When sample size is small or it is thought that habitat preferences are strong, we propose a suite of estimation procedures researchers can consider using.},

  Abstract                 = {A principal challenge of species conservation is to identify the specific habitats that are essential for long-term persistence or recovery of imperiled species. However, many commonly used approaches to identify important habitats do not provide direct insight into the contribution of those habitats to population persistence. To assess how habitats contribute to overall population viability and characterize their relative importance, a spatially-explicit population viability model was used to integrate a species occurrence model with habitat quality and demographic information to simulate the population dynamics of the Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) in Alberta, Canada. Long-term productivity (births-deaths) in each patch was simulated and iterative patch removal experiments were conducted to generate estimates of the relative contribution of habitat types to overall population viability. Our results indicated that natural dune habitats are crucial for population viability, while disturbed/human-created habitats make a minor contribution to population persistence. The results also suggest that the habitats currently available to Ord's kangaroo rats in Alberta are unlikely to support long-term persistence. Our approach was useful for identifying habitats that did not contribute to population viability. A large proportion of habitat (39%) represented sinks and their removal increased estimated population viability. The integration of population dynamics with habitat quality and occurrence data can be invaluable when assessing critical habitat, particularly in regions with variable habitat quality. Approaches that do not incorporate population dynamics may undermine conservation efforts by under- or over-estimating the value of habitats, erroneously protecting sink habitats, or failing to prioritize key source habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {We report delayed effects on the growth and marine survival of pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, which were exposed to oil as embryos under conditions similar to those observed after the ‘Exxon Valdez’ oil spill. Pink salmon eggs were incubated in water that became contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) after percolating through gravel coated with weathered oil. Weathering ensured that the PAH composition of the water was dominated by alkyl-substituted naphthalenes and larger compounds. Most survivors of the exposures appeared healthy, and were released to the marine environment with coded-wire tags. Their survival was evaluated when they returned at maturity 2 yr later. Other survivors, also healthy in appearance, were retained in net pens to measure delayed effects on growth during the early juvenile stage. Pink salmon exposed to an initial concentration of total PAH equal to 5.4 ppb experienced a 15% decrease in marine survival compared to unexposed salmon. A delayed effect on growth was measured in juvenile salmon that survived embryonic exposure to doses as low as 18 ppb PAH. Reductions in juvenile growth could account for the reduced marine survival observed in the released fish. The demonstration of delayed effects on growth and survival support claims of delayed effects in pink salmon after the ‘Exxon Valdez’ oil spill, and indicate the potential for population-level effects resulting from embryonic exposure to oil.},

  Abstract                 = {Colonial epifauna are an important component of benthic communities, providing structural complexity at scales of millimetres to metres. Many are sessile, emergent and fragile-characteristics which render them vulnerable to disturbances associated with bottom fishing. Many also have impressive abilities to rapidly regenerate both sexually and asexually and, consequently, the ultimate results of impacts of physical disturbance are difficult to predict. We analysed the effects of 3 yr of pulsed experimental otter trawling, following an asymmetrical before-after-control-impact design, on grab-sampled colonial epifauna. Our study site was on a cobble seabed on the Scotian Shelf in a formerly important fishing ground which had seen no disturbance by mobile fishing gears for 10 yr. The number of taxa, total biomass, the biomass of component major taxa (hydroids, bryozoans, sponges, tunicates, soft corals) and the community composition were analysed for single-year and cumulative effects. The study site had a rich colonial fauna containing at least 53 taxa, the majority of which were hydroids. The small vase sponge Scypha ciliata, the leafy bryozoans Dendrobeania spp. and the hydroids Symplectoscyphus spp. were the most frequent, occurring in > 70\% of the samples. Significant inter-annual differences at control sites were observed. The number of taxa, total biomass and hydroid biomass increased over the study period, with associated changes in community composition. Short-term effects of trawling were detected as decreases in the number of taxa per sample, total biomass and total hydroid biomass across the trawling events, although these trends were non-significant after Bonferroni adjustment. No cumulative effects from the pulsed trawling were detected, and colonial species assemblages on control and impacted lines were similar at the end of the experiment. While some of the tests for trawling effects were statistically weak, it is certain that any effects were small relative to natural inter-annual change.},

  Abstract                 = {This study addresses the effect of mobile fishing gear disturbance on benthic megafaunal production on the gravel pavement of northern Georges Bank. From 1994 to 2000, we sampled benthic megafauna with a 1 m Naturalists' dredge at shallow (47 to 62 m) and deep (80 to 90 m) sites. The cessation of fishing in large areas of Georges Bank in January 1995 allowed us to monitor changes in production at a previously disturbed site. Production at a shallow disturbed site varied little over the sampling period (32 to 57 kcal m(-2) yr(-1)) and was markedly lower than production at the nearby recovering site, where production increased from 17 kcal m(-2) yr(-1) in 1994 before the closure to 215 kcal m(-2) yr(-1) in 2000. Atlantic sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus and green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis dominated production at the recovering site. The community production:biomass ratio decreased over time at the recovering site as the sea scallop population matured. At the deep sites, production remained significantly higher at undisturbed sites (174 to 256 kcal m(-2) yr(-1)) than at disturbed sites (30 to 52 kcal m(-2) yr(-1)). The soft-bodied tube-building polychaete Thelepus cincinnatus dominated production at the undisturbed site, while hard-shelled bivalve molluscs Astarte spp. and P. magellanicus were prevalent at the disturbed site. Mobile fishing gear disturbance has a conspicuous effect on benthic megafaunal production in this hard-bottom habitat. Cessation of mobile fishing has resulted in a marked increase in benthic megafaunal production. These findings should help fishery managers to gauge the costs and benefits of management tools such as area closures and low-impact fishing gears.},

  abstract  = {Unlike most anadromous fishes that have evolved strict homing behaviour, Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) seem to lack philopatry as evidenced by minimal population structure across the species range. Yet unexplained findings of within-region population genetic heterogeneity coupled with the morphological and behavioural diversity described for the species suggest that adaptive genetic variation underlying fitness traits may be responsible. We employed restriction siteâ€“associated DNA sequencing to genotype 4439 quality filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 518 individuals collected across a broad geographical area including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California. A subset of putatively neutral markers (NÂ =Â 4068) identified a significant amount of variation among three broad populations: northern British Columbia, Columbia River/southern coast and â€˜dwarfâ€™ adults (FCTÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ â‰ªÂ 0.001). Additionally, 162 SNPs were identified as adaptive through outlier tests, and inclusion of these markers revealed a signal of adaptive variation related to geography and life history. The majority of the 162 adaptive SNPs were not independent and formed four groups of linked loci. Analyses with matsam software found that 42 of these outlier SNPs were significantly associated with geography, run timing and dwarf life history, and 27 of these 42 SNPs aligned with known genes or highly conserved genomic regions using the genome browser available for sea lamprey. This study provides both neutral and adaptive context for observed genetic divergence among collections and thus reconciles previous findings of population genetic heterogeneity within a species that displays extensive gene flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Methods for assessing habitat sensitivity to human impacts are needed to gauge the sustainability of existing impacts, develop spatial management plans and support meaningful environmental impact assessments. These methods should be quantitative, validated, repeatable and applicable at the scales of impact and management. Existing methods for assessing the sensitivity of marine habitats to human impacts have tended to rely on expert judgement and/or scoring systems. They are neither validated, quantitative nor repeatable. We have developed a method that meets the criteria for assessing the sensitivity of seabed habitats to physical disturbance, and delineating and mapping habitat sensitivity at large spatial scales (> 10(5) km(2)). The method assumes that sensitivity is related to the recovery time of production or biomass, as predicted using a size-based model that takes account of the effects of natural disturbance. As trawling disturbance is a major and widespread direct human impact on shelf seas, this was used as an example of anthropogenic physical disturbance. We mapped habitat sensitivity to trawling in 9-km(2) boxes across an area of 125 000 km(2) in the North Sea. Habitat sensitivities varied widely, and a trawling frequency of 5 year(-1) in the least-sensitive habitat had the same ecological effect as a trawling frequency of 0.3 year(-1) in the most-sensitive habitat (based on production). When trawling effort was held constant but redirected to the least-sensitive habitats, the existing impacts on production and biomass were reduced by 36\% and 25\%, respectively. Synthesis and applications. The method described in this paper enables managers to predict the implications of changing patterns of human impact on seabed habitats when establishing spatial management plans. In the context of fisheries management, this will support the identification and selection of fishing grounds that minimize the adverse ecological effects of fishing; the selection of closed areas (both representative and highly sensitive); the comparison of management options that might reduce the overall environmental impacts of fishing; and any future steps towards the application of environmental impact assessment in advance of fishery development.},

  Abstract                 = {Bottom trawling causes widespread disturbance of sediments in shelf seas and can have a negative impact on benthic fauna. We conducted a large-scale assessment of bottom trawl fishing of benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical, size-based model that included habitat features. Species richness was estimated based on a generalized body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range of trawling intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts of trawling were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact of trawling was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the North Sea, the model showed that the bottom trawl fleet reduced benthic biomass and production by 56\% and 21\%, respectively, compared with an unfished situation. Because of the many simplifications and assumptions required to synthesize these data, additional work is required to refine the model and evaluate applicability in other geographic areas. Our model enables managers to understand the consequences of altering the distribution of fishing activities on benthic production and hence on food web processes.},

However, such models are often based on unrealistic ecological assumptions, such as global dispersal and no local population dynamics. 
2 - We develop a plant metapopulation model that allows us to sequentially relax unrealistic assumptions about dispersal and local population interactions. We use our model to examine the extent to which the conclusions of analytical, patch-based coexistence models depend on their assumptions. 
3 - We found that the need for an inferior competitor to be a superior colonizer was reduced by using a dispersal kernel to distribute seeds, and totally removed by relaxing the assumption of instantaneous competitive displacement. These results hold for annual or perennial plants with or without seedbanks, for global, local and stratified dispersal, for delayed competitive exclusion, two-way competition and neighbourhood competition, and for landscapes where habitat patches are either adjacent or disjunct. 
4 - We conclude that the results of patch-occupancy metapopulation models differ greatly from results of models that incorporate more realistic assumptions about dispersal and local population dynamics. As a result it may be premature to base biodiversity management and policy on the results of patch-occupancy models.},

  Abstract                 = {The escapement of Pacific salmon is often estimated by periodic counts of spawners, calculating the number of fish-days present and dividing by the average number of days a fish spends in the survey area. We present a maximum likelihood method to calculate the number of spawning fish and compare this approach with the most commonly used method, which relies on linear interpolation between observations. The maximum likelihood method is computationally more demanding; however, it does provide a statistical basis for describing uncertainty and can also be used to deal with data sets where the first or last counts are nonzero or where there are few observations. We compared escapement estimation methods using data from 18 experimental streams where the number of fish in the stream was evaluated by weir and carcass counts. In this comparison, the method of linear interpolation deviated from the weir count by an average of 19%, whereas the maximum likelihood method deviated by 23, 24, 30, or 40% depending upon which likelihood and arrival time model was used. We conclude that for most data sets where measures of uncertainty are not required, the linear interpolation method is adequate but recommend an examination of maximum likelihood methods when an estimate of uncertainty is required.},

Regulations require the release of trawl- oaught halibut, but the survival of the released halibut is unknown. The condition of halibut caught by ]apanese trawlers indicates that survival is low. The survival of halibut released by domestic trawlers was estimated from the recovery rate of tags and from expected rates of natural mortality and other losses. Survival was positively correIated with Iength of fish and negatively correlated with time on deck and weight of total catch: The average survival from domestic trawlers was about 50%.

  Abstract                 = {Management of fisheries around the world is challenged by fishing impacts on habitats, bycatch species, threatened and endangered species, and even associated ecological communities. One response to these other factors has been a call for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which demands consideration of the above non-target interactions. A challenge with implementation of EBFM is the scale and range of issues to be considered, all of which cannot be addressed at the same level of detail as for target species, due to data or time constraints. We developed an approach to progress the EBFM mandate in Australia, using a new ecological risk assessment framework applied to fisheries, termed Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Novel features of this framework include its hierarchical structure and its precautionary approach to uncertainty. The amount of information required increases through the hierarchy, and allows application in data-limited situations. The ERAEF framework has been applied to over 30 fisheries in Australia and elsewhere. The efficiencies in application of the hierarchical approach are illustrated by the south-east otter trawl fishery, where following Level 1 assessment of all components, an initial set of 600 species and 158 habitats was reduced to a group of concern of 159 species and 46 habitats using the Level 2 analysis, with the number of species of concern further reduced to 25 following Level 3 analysis. As a result of the assessments in Australia, management actions have been enacted for a range of the high risk species. Overall, the ERAEF approach offers a realistic method to assess ecological risk in an EBFM context, and has applicability in a wide range of fisheries. The interactive and inclusive nature of the approach also has the advantage of bringing stakeholders, scientists and managers together to develop management solutions.},

  abstract  = {Most ecologists use statistical methods as their main analytical tools when analyzing data to identify relationships between a response and a set of predictors; thus, they treat all analyses as hypothesis tests or exercises in parameter estimation. However, little or no prior knowledge about a system can lead to creation of a statistical model or models that do not accurately describe major sources of variation in the response variable. We suggest that under such circumstances data mining is more appropriate for analysis. In this paper we 1) present the distinctions between data-mining (usually exploratory) analyses and parametric statistical (confirmatory) analyses, 2) illustrate 3 strengths of data-mining tools for generating hypotheses from data, and 3) suggest useful ways in which data mining and statistical analyses can be integrated into a thorough analysis of data to facilitate rapid creation of accurate models and to guide further research.},

There is a repeated call for ecological terminology to be standardized and for terms to be defined more concretely. These calls for the standardization of definitions are based on faulty premises about the way language conveys meaning. Most recommendations for definitional reform are unlikely to take hold due to properties of language and they are unlikely to stimulate increased ecological understanding. Precisely delimited definitions are necessary in very few instances, whereas extensive and prescriptive classification can hinder the development of a field by preventing some types of questions from being asked. Useful lexical reviews should focus on the development of ecological knowledge that is signaled by a wealth of terms and meanings, rather than critiquing the terms employed.},

Issues include the use of science during designation, the costly and litigious delays in designation that have led to repeated lawsuits, and the potential overlap with other ESA protections. In this paper, we address a neglected aspect of critical habitat designation: how the biologically-based designation criteria of the US Fish and Wildlife Service are used during the designation process. We primarily examine whether taxon (within terrestrial animals) or legal status (whether critical habitat was designated after a court challenge) affect the use of the criteria. Court-ordered cases used more criteria than non-court-ordered cases. There were also differences in use of criteria with respect to taxon and region, and a weak relationship with the year of designation. Criteria that focused on discrete elements, such as nest sites or locations where required food species occurred, were used more often than criteria that addressed broader ecological needs such as space for normal behaviour or representation of historic range conditions. Revising the critical habitat designation criteria and enforcing their consistent use during designation would be helpful for conservation of imperiled species in the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are widespread in boreal and montane forests of North America, vary in their temporal dynamics, and are major drivers in their food webs. In Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, hare abundance, distribution, and temporal dynamics are unknown, yet Yellowstone contains a large area within their southern range that is relatively unfragmented by human activities. The 1988 Yellowstone fires have led to extensive regenerating stands, a seral condition that elsewhere supports relatively high numbers of hares. To examine snowshoe hare dynamics in the park from 2002 to 2007, we surveyed stands within 7 cover types and estimated abundance for a subset of sites. Both livetrapping data and fecal pellet count surveys showed that snowshoe hares are rare in Yellowstone. More than 36% of surveyed stands did not support any hares. Mature forest cover types were more likely to have hares than were stands regenerating after the 1988 fires, but very few stands supported high numbers; 96% of stands had <0.5 hares/ha. Three stands that burned in 2003 had hares before the fire, but none afterward. Hare numbers fluctuated modestly over time, but patterns were not indicative of a cycle. Taken altogether, our results indicate that snowshoe hares in Yellowstone are rare, patchily distributed, and apparently acyclic, important findings both for understanding hare dynamics and for implications for the Yellowstone food web that includes the federally Threatened Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis).},

Population viability can depend on habitat area, habitat quality, the spatial arrangement of habitats (aggregations and connections) and the properties of the intervening non-breeding (matrix) land. Hodgson et al. [Journal of Applied Ecology46 (2009) 964] and Doerr, Barrett & Doerr (Journal of Applied Ecology, 2011) disagree on the relative importance of these landscape attributes in enabling species to persist and change their distributions in response to climate change. 2. A brief review of published evidence suggests that variations in habitat area and quality have bigger effects than variations in spatial arrangement of habitats or properties of the intervening land. Even if structural features in the matrix have a measurable effect on dispersal rates, this does not necessarily lead to significant increases in population viability. 3. Large and high-quality habitats provide source populations and locations for colonisation, so they are the main determinants of the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change because populations must be established successively in each new region. 4. Synthesis and applications. Retaining as much high quality natural and semi-natural habitat as possible should remain the key focus for conservation, especially during a period of climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) generally requires that critical habitat be designated for all species listed as endangered or threatened. However, it has been designated for only ~10% of listed species. Recently, in response to several recent court orders and settlement agreements that require critical habitat to be designated for ~300 species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided to divert all available budget resources for 2001 to address the backlog of designations. This decision underscores a central question in the controversies surrounding critical habitat designation: How does critical habitat benefit the conservation and eventual recovery of listed species? Here, we examined how designation of critical habitat influenced the recovery planning process by comparing the content and characteristics of recovery plans for species with and without designated critical habitat. Critical habitat designation did not increase the availability of information on species' habitat requirements or increase the likelihood that recovery plans prescribed habitat management or habitat acquisition among the necessary recovery tasks. Recovery plans for species with critical habitat were not more likely to include habitat considerations among criteria for measuring recovery. Recovery plans for species with critical habitat uniformly ranked habitat concerns among the top threats to species and, on average, proposed a greater diversity of habitat monitoring efforts. Overall, however, we concluded that critical habitat designations have had negligible positive influence in the recovery planning process. We discuss possible explanations and suggest a standards-based system for designating critical habitat that should promote more effective contributions to recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species.},

  Abstract                 = {The reliability of sockeye-salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) count data collected by a dual-frequency, identification sonar (DIDSON) system is evaluated on the basis of comparisons with visual counts of unconstrained migrating salmon and visual counts of salmon constrained to passing through an enumeration fence. Regressions fitted to the DIDSON count data and the visual count data from the enumeration fence were statistically indistinguishable from a line with slope¼ 1.0 passing through the origin, which we interpret as agreement in both counts. In contrast, the regressions fitted to the DIDSON count data and the unconstrained visual count data had slopes that were significantly <1.0 ( p < 0.001) and are consistent with an interpretation of systematic bias in these data. When counts of both unconstrained and constrained fish from the DIDSON system were >50 fish event-1, repeated counts of the DIDSON files were observed to produce the same counts 98e99% of the time, respectively, and based on the coefficient of variation, counts of individual passage events varied <3% on average. Therefore, the DIDSON count data exhibit high precision among different observers. As an enumeration fence provides a complete census of all fish passing through it, we conclude that fish-count data produced by the DIDSON imaging system are as accurate as visual counts of fish passing through an enumeration fence when counts range up to 932 fish event-1, the maximum count recorded during our study, regardless of the observer conducting the count. These conclusions should be applicable to typical riverine applications of the DIDSON system in which the bottom and surface boundaries are suitable for acoustic imaging, the migrating fish are adult salmon, and the transducer is carefully aimed so that the beams ensonify the area through which the salmon are migrating.},

Classification tree models and maps were developed for macroalgae (all types, mixed red algae, Ecklonia, and rhodoliths) and sessile invertebrates (all types, sponges, and ascidians). Model accuracy was tested on 25% of the video observation dataset reserved from modelling. Models fit well for most macroalgae categories (correct classification rates of 67--84%), but are not as good for sessile invertebrate classes (correct classification rates of 57--62%). The poor fit of the sessile invertebrate models may be the combined result of grouping organisms with different environmental requirements and the effect of false absences recorded during video interpretation due to poor image quality. Probability maps, binary single-class maps, and multi-class maps supply spatially explicit, detailed information on the distribution of sessile benthic biota within the MNP and provide information at a landscape-scale for ecological investigations and marine management.},

  Abstract                 = {Those developing conservation strategies that include protected areas to ensure species persistence are often faced with the difficult choice of selecting a subset of the total area of suitable habitat for protection. In these instances, protecting the most important habitat patches will facilitate efficient resource use, and maximize the probability of metapopulation persistence. However, identifying important patches presents challenges, and important patches may be currently unoccupied which makes their identification even more difficult. To help identify candidate patches for protection, we developed PatchImportance, a tool that quantifies the relative importance of each patch based on its influence on the probability of metapopulation persistence, and metapopulation expected minimum abundance. We demonstrate our analysis using the British Columbia sea otter (Enhydra lutris) metapopulation as a case study.},

  abstract  = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections.
Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence–absence data and those trained on abundance data.
Species distribution models trained on presence–absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 0·32 (SE ± 0·12) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence–absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 0·05 (SE ± 0·01) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence.
Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence–absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence–absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence–absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.},

  abstract  = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {Over-exploitation and subsequent collapse of marine fishes has focused attention on the ability of affected populations to recover to former abundance levels and on the degree to which their persistence is threatened by extinction. Although potential for recovery has been assessed indirectly, actual changes in popula- tion size following long-term declines have not been examined empirically. Here I show that there is very little evidence for rapid recovery from prolonged declines, in contrast to the perception that marine fishes are highly resilient to large population reductions. With the possible exception of herring and related species that mature early in life and are fished with highly selective equipment, my analysis of 90 stocks reveals that many gadids (for example, cod, haddock) and other non-clupeids (for example, flatfishes) have experienced little, if any, recovery as much as 15 years after 45–99% reductions in reproductive biomass. Although the effects of overfishing on single species may generally be reversible, the actual time required for recovery appears to be considerable. To exempt marine fishes from existing criteria used to assign extinction risk would be inconsistent with precau- tionary approaches to fisheries management and the conservation of marine biodiversity.},

Using a newly constructed global database for 207 populations (108 species), we examine whether the 2010 target has been met for marine fishes, while accounting for population biomass relative to maximum sustainable yield, BMSY. Although rate of decline has eased for 59% of populations declining before 1992 (a pattern consistent with a literal interpretation of the target), the percentage of populations below BMSY has remained unchanged and the rate of decline has increased among several top predators, many of which are below 0.5BMSY. Combining population trends, a global multi- species index indicates that marine fishes declined 38% between 1970 and 2007. The index has been below BMSY since the mid-1980s and stable since the early 1990s. With the exception of High Seas pelagic fishes and demersal species in the Northeast Pacific and Australia – New Zealand, the multispecies indices are currently below BMSY in many regions. We conclude that the 2010 CBD target represents a weak standard for recovering marine fish biodiversity and that meaningful progress will require population-specific recovery targets and associated time lines for achieving those targets.},

We offer classification models developed in our laboratory, where point pattern analysis was used to identify presence or absence of a known secondary alluvial (cassiterite) deposits in the Nigerian Younger Granite Region (NYGR) and the model performance assessed. We focused on the training and testing data split using longitudinal spatial data splitting (strips and halves) to ensure predictive attribute's independence. The spatial data split runs counter to the traditional random sample data selection as a procedure for checking overfitting of models mainly due to spatial data autocorrelation. Specifically, we used classification algorithms such as; Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree Bagging and Discriminant Analysis algorithms for training and testing. We analysed the model's performance results using model predictive accuracy and ROC curve values in two different approaches that improve spatial data independence among predictive attributes to give a meaningful model performance.},

  abstract  = {The effective management of our marine ecosystems requires the capability to identify, characterise and predict the distribution of benthic biological communities within the overall seascape architecture. The rapid expansion of seabed mapping studies has seen an increase in the application of automated classification techniques to efficiently map benthic habitats, and the need of techniques to assess confidence of model outputs. We use towed video observations and 11 seafloor complexity variables derived from multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry and backscatter to predict the distribution of 8 dominant benthic biological communities in a 54 km2 site, off the central coast of Victoria, Australia. The same training and evaluation datasets were used to compare the accuracies of a Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and two new generation decision tree methods, QUEST (Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree) and CRUISE (Classification Rule with Unbiased Interaction Selection and Estimation), for predicting dominant biological communities. The QUEST classifier produced significantly better results than CRUISE and MLC model runs, with an overall accuracy of 80% (Kappa 0.75). We found that the level of accuracy with the size of training set varies for different algorithms. The QUEST results generally increased in a linear fashion, CRUISE performed well with smaller training data sets, and MLC performed least favourably overall, generating anomalous results with changes to training size. We also demonstrate how predicted habitat maps can provide insights into habitat spatial complexity on the continental shelf. Significant variation between patch-size and habitat types and significant correlations between patch size and depth were also observed.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of aquatic environmental pollution goes back to the very beginning of the history of human civilization. However, aquatic pollution did not receive much attention until a threshold level was reached with adverse consequences on the ecosystems and organisms. Aquatic pollution has become a global concern, but even so, most developing nations are still producing huge pollution loads and the trends are expected to increase. Knowledge of the pollution sources and impacts on ecosystems is important not only for a better understanding on the ecosystem responses to pollutants but also to formulate prevention measures. Many of the sources of aquatic pollutions are generally well known and huge effort has been devoted to the issue. However, new concepts and ideas on environmental pollution are emerging (e.g., biological pollution) with a corresponding need for an update of the knowledge. The present paper attempts to provide an easy-to-follow depiction on the various forms of aquatic pollutions and their impacts on the ecosystem and organisms.},

Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.},

Because of the bias in probability outputs due to frequency of presences (prevalence), a fixed threshold value, such as 0.5, does not usually correspond to the threshold above which the species is more likely to be present. In this paper four threshold criteria are compared for a wide range of sample sizes and prevalences, modeling a virtual species in order to avoid the omnipresent error sources that the use of real species data implies. In general, sensitivity-specificity difference minimizer and sensitivity-specificity sum maximizer criteria produced the most accurate predictions. The widely-used 0.5 fixed threshold and Kappa-maximizer criteria are the worst ones in almost all situations. Nevertheless, whatever the criteria used, the threshold value chosen and the research goals that determined its choice must be stated.},

  Abstract                 = {Under the terms of Canada’s Oceans Act (1997), Fisheries and Oceans Canada has embarked on an approach to Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) which aims to protect the structure, function, and quality of marine ecosystems from human impacts. This report aims to provide the reader with an overview of the contaminant sources, types, and risks in the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) as these relate to marine environmental quality (MEQ), and builds on two previously published reports generated for sub-regions of the PNCIMA, namely the central coast (Haggarty et al. 2003) and the north coast and Queen Charlotte Islands (Johannessen et al. 2007).
The PNCIMA includes 102,000 km2 of ocean, covering roughly two-thirds of the BC coast. While sparsely populated (3.3% of BC’s total population), the PNCIMA is faced with a growing list of threats to MEQ. The PNCIMA extends from the southern end of Johnstone Strait and the Brooks Peninsula on Vancouver Island northwards to the British Columbia (BC) - Alaska border and includes the marine area out as far as the base of the continental slope, and the Queen Charlotte Islands (Figure 1.1). The region is rugged, with a steep, glaciated mainland covered in dense rainforest and bisected by numerous fjords and inlets, while the coast is dominantly rocky and strewn with islands. The influence of two semi-permanent atmospheric pressure cells (the Aleutian Low and the North Pacific High) over the Pacific Ocean provides this area with some of the highest rainfall amounts in Canada, along with mild winters and cool summers.
The remote location and low population would suggest that there are few anthropogenic stresses in the area. However, a number of human activities take place in the area that can affect MEQ. Key among the past and present activities are aquaculture, vessel traffic, ports / harbours / marinas, forestry, pulp and paper, mining / smelting, ocean dumping, Coast Guard / military sites, oil and gas, and global pollutants. In many cases, source control and regulations have mitigated some of these activities, including a reduction in the by-production of dioxins and furans by pulp mills, the elimination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and many organochlorine (OC) pesticides, and restrictions on the use of tributyltin on ship hulls as an antifoulant. However, a number of emerging threats to MEQ in the PNCIMA reflect growing industrial sectors, and include the potential exploration and extraction of offshore oil and gas, a significant increase in cruise ship traffic, expanding port facilities, and the expanding aquaculture sector.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and
evolution have begun to change the way in which they
analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather
than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach,
they have adopted an approach called model selection,
in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously
confronted with data. Model selection can be
used to identify a single best model, thus lending support
to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to
make inferences based on weighted support from a
complete set of competing models. Model selection is
widely accepted and well developed in certain fields,
most notably in molecular systematics and mark–
recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support
in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape
ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model
selection and highlight several ways that it is now being
implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in
ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative
to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when
more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic nature and diversity of species/' responses to climate change poses significant difficulties for developing robust, long-term conservation strategies. One key question is whether existing protected area networks will remain effective in a changing climate. To test this, we developed statistical models that link climate to the abundance of internationally important bird populations in northwestern Europe. Spatial climate-abundance models were able to predict 56% of the variation in recent 30-year population trends. Using these models, future climate change resulting in 4.0C global warming was projected to cause declines of at least 25% for more than half of the internationally important populations considered. Nonetheless, most EU Special Protection Areas in the UK were projected to retain species in sufficient abundances to maintain their legal status, and generally sites that are important now were projected to be important in the future. The biological and legal resilience of this network of protected areas is derived from the capacity for turnover in the important species at each site as species/' distributions and abundances alter in response to climate. Current protected areas are therefore predicted to remain important for future conservation in a changing climate.},

Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, we studied the effect of the dispersal range on the persistence of a metapopulation as a function of the local population and landscape dynamics (including habitat patch destruction and subsequent regeneration). Our results show that the impact of the dispersal range depends on both the local population and patch growth. This is due to interactions between dispersal and the dynamics of patches and populations via the number of potential dispersers. In general, long-range dispersal had a positive effect on persistence in a dynamic landscape compared to short-range dispersal. Long-range dispersal increases the number of couplings between the patches and thus the colonisation of regenerated patches. However, long-range dispersal lost its advantage for long-term persistence when the number of potential dispersers was low due to small population growth rates and/or small patch growth rates. Its advantage also disappeared with complex local population dynamics and in a landscape with clumped patch distribution.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations.
RESULTS:We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza.
CONCLUSIONS:Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Fishers have been complaining about the effects of bottom trawl gear on the marine environment since at least the 14th century. Trawl gear affects the environment in both direct and indirect ways. Direct effects include scraping and ploughing of the substrate, sediment resuspension, destruction of benthos, and dumping of processing waste. Indirect effects include post-fishing mortality and long-term trawl-induced changes to the benthos. There are few conclusive studies linking trawling to observed environmental changes since it is difficult to isolate the cause. However, permanent faunal changes brought about by trawling have been recorded. Research has established that the degree of environmental perturbation from bottom trawling activities is related to the weight of the gear on the seabed, the towing speed, the nature of the bottom sediments, and the strength of the tides and currents. The greater the frequency of gear impact on an area, die greater the likelihood of permanent change. In deeper water where the fauna is less adapted to changes in sediment regimes and disturbance from storm events, the effects of gear take longer to disappear. Studies indicate that in deep water (> 1000 m), the recovery time is probably measured in decades.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been a dramatic increase in recentyears in the number of papers, reports, etc.,which have been published concerning MarineProtected Areas (MPAs). This overview of theobjectives, selection, design and management ofMPAs aims to provide a basis for discussionregarding possible ways forward by identifyingemerging issues, convergences and divergences. Whilst the attributes of the marine environmentmay limit the effectiveness of site-specificinitiatives such as MPAs, it is argued that itwould be defeatist in the extreme to abandonMPAs in the face of these limitations. Ten keyobjectives for MPAs are discussed, includingthat of harvest refugia, and it is argued thatwhilst these objectives may be justifiable froma preservationist perspective, they may beobjected to from a resource exploitationperspective. MPAs generate both internal(between uses) and basic (between use andconservation) conflicts, and it is argued thatthese conflicts may be exacerbated whenscientific arguments for MPAs are motivated bypreservationist concerns. It is reported thata minority of MPAs are achieving theirmanagement objectives, and that for themajority insufficient information was availablefor such effectiveness evaluations. Structureand process-oriented perspectives on marineconservation are discussed. It is argued thatthere are two divergent stances concerningoptimal MPA management approaches: top-down,characterized as being government-led andscience-based, with a greater emphasis onset-aside; and bottom-up, characterized asbeing community-based and science-guided, witha greater emphasis on multiple-use. Given thedivergent values of different stakeholders, thehigh degree of scientific uncertainty, and thehigh marine resource management decisionstakes, it is concluded that a key challenge isto adopt a ``middle-ground'' approach whichcombines top-down and bottom-up approaches, andwhich is consistent with the post-normalscientific approach.},

  abstract = {Since the fragmentation of natural habitats is one of the most serious problems for many endangered species, it is highly interesting to study the properties of fragmented landscapes. As a basic property, landscape connectivity and its effects on various ecological processes are frequently in focus. First, we discuss the relevance of some graph properties in quantifying connectivity. Then, we propose a method how to quantify the relative importance of habitat patches and corridors in maintaining landscape connectivity. Our combined index explicitly considers pure topological properties and topographical measures, like the quality of both patches (local population size) and corridors (permeability). Finally, for illustration, we analyze the landscape graph of the endangered, brachypterous bush-cricket Pholidoptera transsylvanica. The landscape contains 11 patches and 13 corridors and is situated on the Aggtelek Karst, NE-Hungary. We characterize the importance of each node and link of the graph by local and global network indices. We show how different measures of connectivity may suggest different conservation preferences. We conclude, accordingly to our present index, by identifying one specific habitat patch and one specific corridor being in the most critical positions in maintaining connectivity.},

The current drive towards an ecosystem approach in fisheries management requires a consideration of the implications of habitat deterioration and an understanding of the potential for restoration. We undertook a meta-analysis of 101 different fishing impact manipulations. The direct effects of different types of fishing gear were strongly habitat-specific. The most severe impact occurred in biogenic habitats in response to scallop-dredging. Analysis of the response of different feeding guilds to disturbance from fishing revealed that both deposit- and suspension-feeders were consistently vulnerable to scallop dredging across gravel, sand and mud habitats, while the response of these groups to beam-trawling was highly dependent upon habitat type. The biota of soft-sediment habitats, in particular muddy sands, were surprisingly vulnerable, with predicted recovery times measured in years. Slow-growing large-biomass biota such as sponges and soft corals took much longer to recover (up to 8 yr) than biota with shorter life-spans such as polychaetes (< 1 yr). The results give a possible basis for predicting the outcome of the use of different fishing gears in a variety of habitats with potential utility in a management context.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Bottom fishing using towed nets and dredges is one of the most widespread sources of physical disturbance to the continental shelf seas throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that degradation and ecosystem changes have occurred in intensively fished areas. Nevertheless, to date it has been diffcult to attribute habitat and benthic community changes to fishing effort at a spatial scale that is truly representative of commercial fishing activities.
2. In this study we present convincing evidence that chronic bottom-fishing disturbance has caused significant and widespread changes in the structure of two distinct soft-sediment benthic assemblages and habitats.
3. Our study compared the benthic fauna found in areas that have been exposed to either high or low levels of bottom-fishing disturbance over the past 10 years. We were able to validate the fishing effort data in some areas using scars in the shells of a long-lived bivalve mollusc (Glycymeris glycymeris) which result from fishing disturbance. Shell scars occurred most frequently in bivalves collected from the area of highest fishing effort.
4. Multivariate analyses and the response of abundance/biomass curves indicated that chronic fishing has caused a shift from communities dominated by relatively sessile, emergent, high biomass species to communities dominated by infaunal, smaller-bodied fauna. Removal of emergent fauna has thus degraded the topographic complexity of seabed habitats in areas of high fishing effort. The commu nities within these areas currently may be in an alternative stable state.},

  Abstract                 = {When two commercially important marine species coexist in the same habitat, conflict may arise between different sectors of the fishing industry. A good example of this situation is when fishers using towed bottom-fishing gear (scallop dredges, beam trawls, and otter trawls) operate in the same areas in which fixed-bottom gear (crab pots) are deployed. We examined an area subject to a voluntary agreement between these two sectors of the fishing industry such that some areas are used exclusively by fixed-gear fishers, some are shared seasonally by both sectors, and others are open to all methods of fishing all year. This agreement was enacted to resolve conflict between the two sectors of the industry. An additional possible benefit of this agreement is the protection of the seabed from towed bottom-fishing gear, which is one of the greatest sources of anthropogenic disturbance of seabed habitats worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that complex emergent epifaunal communities are substantially altered by such activities This habitat alteration in turn influences closely associated species, some of which may be of commercial importance. We undertook comparative surveys of the benthic habitat and communities within the area covered by the agreement and compared different areas subjected to a range of fishing disturbance regimes. Communities found within the areas closed to towed fishing gears were significantly different from those open to fishing either permanently or seasonally. Abundance-biomass curves demonstrated that the communities within the dosed areas were dominated by higher biomass and emergent fauna that increased habitat complexity. Areas fished by towed gear were dominated by smaller-bodied fauna and scavenging taxa. Scallop dredges and beam trawls used on more stable habitats appear to have greater impacts on the environment than lighter otter trawls used in shallower water with less stable sediments. It would appear from our data that conflict management in the form of gear-restriction measures has the added benefit of conserving habitats and benthic fauna sensitive to bottom-fishing disturbance.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Beam-trawling is a source of physical disturbance to marine sedimentary communities in areas less than 50m deep, on the western Europea n continental shelf. Chains attached between the beam-trawl shoes are designed to penetrate the upper few cm of the sediment, which leads to the damag e or removal of some infaunal and epifaunal species. In some areas, beam-trawling may be frequent and intense, leading to speculation that it may gene rate long-term changes in the local benthic fauna. 2. As part of a larger MAFF study examining the ecological effects of beam-trawling, we investigate d its local impact on an infaunal community in the north-eastern Irish Sea. Studies of this type are complicated by the heterogeneity of the environme nt, hence we adopted a replicated, paired control and treatment design to maximize the chances of detecting any effects due to trawling. 3. A side-sca n sonar survey revealed that the experimental area was characterized by mobile megaripples in the south-eastern sector of the experimental area and st able sediments with uniform topography in the north-western sector. Multivariate analysis of the species abundances from the control areas separated t he fauna into two distinct communities which corresponded to the different substratum characteristics. Data from the two regions were therefore treate d separately when testing for the effects of trawling. 4. In the north-western sector, trawling led to 58% decrease in the mean abundance of some taxa and a 50% reduction in the mean number of species per sample. Multivariate analysis revealed that differences between control and fished sites were l argely due to the reduction or removal of less common species. These effects were less apparent in the mobile sediments of the south-eastern sector, w hich had a naturally impoverished fauna and high level of heterogeneity. 5. Univariate variables, such as abundance and the total number of species pe r sample, indicated that the variation between replicate samples increased as a result of trawling disturbance. However, examination of the community data using an index of multivariate dispersion revealed no difference between fished and unfished areas. This suggests that the effects of fishing dis turbance are consistent between replicate samples. 6. Fishing with demersal gears modifies communities in relatively stable sediments. Frequent and re peated physical disturbance by fishing gears may lead to long-term changes in the benthic community structure of these habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessment of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires the ability to quantify the effects of proposed MPA size and placement, habitat distribution, larval dispersal, and fishing on the persistence of protected populations. Here we describe a model-based approach to assessment of the contribution of a network of marine protected areas to the persistence of populations with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersing larval phase. The model integrates the effects of a patchy spatial distribution of habitat, the spatial scale of larval dispersal, and the level of fishing outside of reserves into a calculation of the spatial distribution of equilibrium settlement. We use the amount of coastline predicted to have equilibrium settlement rates that saturate post-settlement habitat as a response variable for the assessment and comparison of MPA network designs. We apply this model to a set of recently proposed MPA networks for the central coast of California, USA. Results show that the area of habitat set aside is a good predictor of the area over which population levels will be high for short-distance dispersers. However, persistence of longer distance dispersers depends critically on the spatial distribution of habitat and reserves, ranging from not persistent anywhere to persistent over a greater area than that set aside in reserves. These results depend on the mechanisms of persistence, with self-replacement supporting short-distance dispersers and network effects supporting long-distance dispersers. Persistence also depends critically on fishery status outside the MPAs, as well as how fishing effort is redistributed after MPA implementation. This assessment method provides important benchmarks, as well as a transparent modeling approach, for improving initial MPA configurations that may result from less-comprehensive rule- or habitat-based methods of designing MPAs.},

Overexploitation is the most frequent threat to vulnerable marine species, with approximately half of threatened species caught as bycatch in fisheries. Habitat degradation, the primary threat to terrestrial species, ranks second in impact on marine species. Loss of listed marine species would probably affect ecosystem function and delivery of ecosystem services because many of these species are strong interactors, including ecosystem engineers, taxa that provide important nutrient links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and a disproportionate number of high trophic-level predators.},

  abstract  = {Apostichopus (= Stichopus) japonicus blastulae and gastrulae were acclimated for 18 h to salinities of 32‰ (control), 24 and 22‰ (the lower limit of the range of tolerance), and 20‰ (below the range of tolerance). Acclimation to 20‰ resulted in the appearance of teratic larvae, most of which subsequently died. Acclimation to 24, 22, and 20‰ led to a shift in the range of tolerance of the larvae at further stages of development. With a decrease in salinity, acclimated larvae developed more successfully than unacclimated larvae. Acclimated larvae attained the pentactula stage and settled at a salinity range of 32–20‰; unacclimated larvae, at 32–22‰. At different stages of development, acclimated larvae survived greater decreases in salinity than unacclimated larvae. The acclimation effects could be traced up to metamorphosis and settling, i.e., two weeks after the end of the acclimation process.},

Current methods for assessing these responses fail to provide an integrated view of these influences because they deal with habitat change or population dynamics, but rarely both. In this study, we linked a time series of habitat suitability models with spatially explicit stochastic population models to explore factors that influence the viability of plant species populations under stable and changing climate scenarios in South African fynbos, a global biodiversity hot spot. Results indicate that complex interactions between life history, disturbance regime and distribution pattern mediate species extinction risks under climate change. Our novel mechanistic approach allows more complete and direct appraisal of future biotic responses than do static bioclimatic habitat modelling approaches, and will ultimately support development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses due to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {This study provides an update of the quantity of discards in the world’s marine fisheries based on a fishery-by-fishery approach. The weighted discard rate is estimated at 8 percent (proportion of the catch discarded). Based on this discard rate, in the 1992– 2001 period, yearly average discards are estimated to be 7.3 million tonnes. Because of the different method used in the current estimate, it is not directly comparable with the previous estimates of 27 million and 20 million tonnes.
Trawl fisheries for shrimp and demersal finfish account for over 50 percent of total estimated discards while representing approximately 22 percent of total landings recorded in the study. Tropical shrimp trawl fisheries have the highest discard rate and account for over 27 percent of total estimated discards. Demersal finfish trawls account for 36 percent of the estimated global discards. Most purse-seine, handline, jig, trap and pot fisheries have low discard rates. Small-scale fisheries generally have lower discard rates than industrial fisheries. The small-scale fisheries account for over 11 percent of the discard database landings and have a weighted discard rate of 3.7 percent.
Evidence is presented for a substantial reduction in discards in recent years. The major reasons for this are a reduction in unwanted bycatch and increased utilization of catches. Bycatch reduction is largely a result of the use of more selective fishing gears, introduction of bycatch and discard regulations, and improved enforcement of regulatory measures. Increased retention of bycatch for human or animal food results from improved processing technologies and expanding market opportunities for lower- value catch.
A number of policy issues are discussed. These include a “no-discards” approach to fisheries management; the need for balance between bycatch reduction and bycatch utilization initiatives; and concerns arising from incidental catches of marine mammals, birds and reptiles. The study advocates the development of more robust methods of estimating discards, allowance for discards in fishery management plans, development of bycatch management plans and promotion of best practices for bycatch reduction and mitigation of incidental catches. Global discard estimates could achieve greater precision through additional studies at national and regional levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of presence / absence records from two comparable megabenthic surveys of scallop grounds in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, in 1966-67 and 1997 showed profound change over three decades. There were no indications that any species were lost and the average number of taxa per station remained steady. However, spatial heterogeneities in the community were reduced and species composition changed significantly. Some taxa widespread in 1966-67 declined while others expanded, with frequencies of occurrence of individual taxa changing by up to 71\%. The whelks Buccinum undatum and Colus spp., the bivalves Astarte spp. and Cylocardia borealis, the toad crabs Hyas spp., the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and the brittle stars (Ophiurida) showed particular increases. Corresponding declines were seen in the boring sponges Cliona spp., the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus, the scallop Chlamys islandica. the fan worm Pseudopotamilla reniformis and the stalked tunicate Boltenia ovifera. Replacement of attached, fragile, epifaunal, filter-feeding taxa by a combination of motile scavengers, motile filter-feeders and robust, burrowing filter-feeders suggests that the primary cause of the temporal change was physical impacts by fishing gear, even though trawling and scallop dragging in the area were neither intense nor new developments. Secondary causes of change may have included other ecosystem effects of fishing (supply of discards and bait), a mass mortality of scallops and a range expansion of a bryozoan (Flustra foliacea)},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of otter trawling on a hard-bottom ecosystem on Western Bank on Canada's Scotian Shelf were examined experimentally from 1997 to 1999 with an asymmetrical BACI design. The site was located within an area that had been closed to fishing since 1987 to protect juvenile haddock. An experimental line was trawled 12-14 times on three separate occasions over a 20 month period. The benthic macrofauna, and megafauna were sampled before and after trawling on both impact and control lines with both a grab and a photographic system. The 100 grab samples collected contained 341 taxa, primarily polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs, the majority (60\%) of which were epifaunal. Biomass was dominated by the horse-mussel Modiolus modiolus, a long-lived bivalve, while the tube-building amphipod Ericthonius fasciatus was the most abundant species. Through the study period the benthos on the control lines showed little qualitative or quantitative change in individual taxa or community metrics. However, the abundance of 24 individual taxa (polychaetes, amphipods, echinoderms and molluscs) changed significantly, with the majority of these increasing. This resulted in a significantly different relative abundance of taxa between years as detected through ANOSIM. A significant change in relative biomass amongst the taxa was also observed. Trawling had few detectable immediate effects on the abundance or biomass of individual taxa and none on community composition. A few taxa, primarily a mixture of polychaetes and amphipods, decreased significantly after trawling and data from fish stomachs collected during the experiment (Kenchington, E.L., Gordon Jr., D.C., Bourbonnais-Boyce, C., Maclsaac, K.G., Gilkinson, K.D., McKeown, D.L., Vass, W.P., 2005. Effects of experimental otter trawling on the feeding of demersal fish on Western Bank, Nova Scotia. Amer. Fish. Soc. Symp. 41, 391-409) showed that some of these were scavenged by demersal fish. Fifteen taxa showed significant decreases after trawling when the cumulative effects of trawling were considered. As in the analyses of individual years the species affected were primarily high turn-over species such as polychaetes and amphipods. Dominance curves prepared for both control and impact samples before trawling in 1997 and after trawling in 1999 showed a marked decrease in the biomass values of the highest ranking taxa, particularly of the first species, M modiolus, only on the impact line at the conclusion of the experiment. The proportion of epifaunal biomass also declined significantly from 90\% to 77\% on the impact line by the conclusion of the experiment. These changes are in part due to trawl-induced damage and subsequent predation by demersal fish of the top ranking species. Analysis of the photographic images showed that the three top-ranking species in terms of biomass, M modiolus, the tube-building polychaete Thelepus cincinnatus, and the brachiopod Terebraturlina septentrionalis, were visibly damaged more than other species by the trawl gear. Two of these species, M modiolus and T cincinnatus, were preyed upon by scavenging demersal fish. The use of multiple sampling devices at the experimental site (grab, photographic system reported here and trawl and fish stomachs reported by Kenchington, E.L., Gordon Jr., D.C., Bourbonnais-Boyce, C., Maclsaac, K.G., Gilkinson, K.D., McKeown, D.L., Vass, WP., 2005. Effects of experimental otter trawling on the feeding of demersal fish on Western Bank, Nova Scotia. Amer. Fish. Soc. Symp. 41, 391-409) enabled us to link trawl-induced changes to the benthos to redation by demersal fish. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {* 1Effective decision-making in environmental management requires the consideration of multiple objectives that may conflict. Common optimization methods use weights on the multiple objectives to aggregate them into a single value, neglecting valuable insight into the relationships among the objectives in the management problem. * 2We present a multi-objective optimization procedure that approximates the non-dominated Pareto frontier without the use of weightings, allowing for visualization of the trade-offs among objectives. The non-dominated Pareto frontier is approximated by the simultaneous optimization of a vector objective function; two vector objective functions are defined as non-dominated if improvement with respect to one objective is at the detriment of another objective. * 3We demonstrate the method with a case study for the optimum distribution of forest fuels treatments that reduce the impact of fire on a forest. The multiple objectives are to protect habitat of an endangered species, protect late successional forest reserves and minimize the total area treated. In the comparison of three optimization searches, the number of non-dominated solutions increases with the dimensions of the objective space, but with only two objectives the search is ineffective in minimizing fire impact in the different landscape types. Key challenges include the extensive computation time required to approximate the non-dominated set, and reducing the number of solutions that are analysed in detail. * 4Synthesis and applications. The multi-objective optimization program presented can be adapted to other environmental management problems, and easily incorporates a wide range of quantifiable objectives. This tool provides decision-makers with a set of alternatives that estimates the full range of trade-offs among multiple objectives and provides a common ground from which dialogue can come to an informed compromise and decision in environmental management problems.},

  Abstract                 = {An understanding of the mechanisms underlying population persistence makes fisheries management more effective. A model framework is described, which can test hypotheses about spatial structure and connectivity within and between populations and their influence on the productivity (spawning-stock biomass, SSB), stability (variation in SSB), resilience (time to rebuild SSB after environmental disturbance), and sustainability (maximum sustainable fishing mortality and yield) of systems. The general model consists of linked age-structured submodels that incorporate the unique demographics and dynamics of population components, along with the degree and type of connectivity between them. The flexibility of this framework is illustrated with three case studies examining (i) spatial structure within a population of white perch, (ii) different types and degrees of connectivity between populations of Atlantic herring, and (iii) spatial heterogeneity and connectivity within a stock of Atlantic cod. System variance is reduced by abundant, stable population components, and the asynchronous responses of those components. Components with high productivity contributed disproportionately to the resilience of systems. Increased synchrony of component responses to environmental forcing decreased the stability of the overall system. Simulation modelling is a useful approach to evaluate the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity, and can be used to understand better the productivity and dynamics of local and regional populations.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to the Exxon Valdez incident, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was enacted as allegedly comprehensive oil pollution legislation. There have been changes in the patterns of oil spills and the strategic response to the Act. The number and volume of oil spills from tank vessels in US waters have fallen considerably without an obvious increase in oil prices since the enactment of the Act. This implies that the Act has successfully served its purpose. The Act may also facilitate the development of other oil pollution regimes including the international regime beyond the US. However, it remains to be seen whether the reduction of oil spills in US waters will be sustained in the future. There is an irreducible risk irrespective of any policy controlling oil pollution risks. The assertion that the Act has been effective in deterring oil spills may be counteracted by statistics demonstrating that the number and quantity of oil spills have also declined worldwide since 1990. It is premature to evaluate the performance of the Act because it has not so far been tested by a major oil spill since its enactment. A major oil spill in US waters in the future would illuminate limitation of the Act and lead to a fundamental reconsideration of the structure of the Act.},

This single application of a formula means that areas of differing priority may contain similar mixes of species, communities or habitats, and may thus lead to imbalance in representation when preservation takes place, with some previously unpreserved or poorly preserved species, communities or habitats being found in several of the new reserves, and others being absent. An iterative method that has been applied to assess priorities for the preservation of threatened species in the central east coast of Tasmania overcomes this difficulty. The area with the highest score in the initial stages of analysis is assumed to be preserved and the weightings of attributes are altered accordingly. These new weightings are applied to locate the area of next highest priority, and the process continues until predetermined preservation goals are met.},

The relationship between numbers of animals reaching a particular site and the distance of that site from the starting point was investigated. Similarly, the effects of directionality (as determined by the variance of the normal distribution used to assign directions of movement), mortality and velocity on the overall rate of success were studied. A negative exponential-type drop off in numbers of animals reaching a site was predicted with increasing distance from the starting point. The relationship between percent success, directionality and rate of mortality was predicted to be curvilinear; the percentage declining with decreased directionality and increased mortality. A positive linear relationship was indicated between the spatial displacement per iteration used and percent success.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The establishment of marine protected areas is often viewed as a conflict between conservation and fishing. We considered consumptive and nonconsumptive interests of multiple stakeholders (i.e., fishers, scuba divers, conservationists, managers, scientists) in the systematic design of a network of marine protected areas along California's central coast in the context of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. With advice from managers, administrators, and scientists, a representative group of stakeholders defined biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic goals that accommodated social needs and conserved marine ecosystems, consistent with legal requirements. To satisfy biodiversity goals, we targeted 11 marine habitats across 5 depth zones, areas of high species diversity, and areas containing species of special status. We minimized adverse socioeconomic impacts by minimizing negative effects on fishers. We included fine-scale fishing data from the recreational and commercial fishing sectors across 24 fisheries. Protected areas designed with consideration of commercial and recreational fisheries reduced potential impact to the fisheries approximately 21% more than protected areas designed without consideration of fishing effort and resulted in a small increase in the total area protected (approximately 3.4%). We incorporated confidential fishing data without revealing the identity of specific fisheries or individual fishing grounds. We sited a portion of the protected areas near land parks, marine laboratories, and scientific monitoring sites to address nonconsumptive socioeconomic goals. Our results show that a stakeholder-driven design process can use systematic conservation-planning methods to successfully produce options for network design that satisfy multiple conservation and socioeconomic objectives. Marine protected areas that incorporate multiple stakeholder interests without compromising biodiversity conservation goals are more likely to protect marine ecosystems.},

In particular, the technique was developed to address the issue of geographic synchrony in ecological variables that may change markedly from year to year such as population density of animals or seed production of trees. The method yields "modified correlograms" that test for significant autocorrelation between sites located within any given range of distances apart. This technique facilitates detecting and understanding spatial processes in a variety of ecological phenomena, including testing the plausibility of causational hypotheses using cross-correlational analyses. Several examples are discussed, including population densities of squirrels in Finland, winter densities of two hawk species in California, and acorn production and radial growth by individual blue oak Quercus douglasii trees in central coastal California.},

We present a maximum likelihood method to compute escapement and uncertainty that accounts for these difficulties using mark-recapture data from radiotelemetry and snorkel surveys. Estimates of escapement were highly sensitive to assumptions about arrival dynamics and survey life, moderately sensitive to the assumed ending date of the run, and insensitive to assumptions about the form of observation error. Discharge and diver visibility explained between 69 and 78% of the variation in observer efficiency. Simulations revealed that declines in observer efficiency over the duration of the run increased bias and variability in escapement estimates but that this can be mitigated to a limited extent by increasing the number of surveys. The simulations also provided evidence that our likelihood approach was superior to the standard area-under-the-curve method for computing escapement when estimates of the numbers present over time are affected by substantial sampling error.},

  Abstract                 = {Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat—tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant—speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction—diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat—tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions.},

The BRT technique combined with remote sensing and traditional spatial modelling succeeded in identifying, constructing and testing functionality of abiotic environmental predictors on the coverage of benthic macrophyte and invertebrate species. Our models easily predicted a large quantity of macrophyte and invertebrate species cover and recaptured multitude of interactions between environment and biota indicating a strong potential of the method in the modelling of aquatic species in the large variety of ecosystems.},

Theoretically, compartments increase the stability in networks such as food webs. Compartments have been difficult to detect in empirical food webs because of incompatible approaches or insufficient methodological rigour. Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance of the results. A graphical presentation reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by compartments. From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs},

Using this information, we developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict the probability of occurrence of five commonly observed taxa (cup corals, hydroids, short and tall sea pens, and brittle stars in the sediment) within the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). We employed a utility-based approach to validate the models and to identify optimal cutoff thresholds for the GLM predictions, given a relative cost of false negatives and false positives. We present optimal cutoff values under a range of cost ratios. Out-of-sample predictive accuracy, assuming equal costs of false negatives and false positives, ranged from 75% to 89%. Estimated area under the characteristic curve (AUC) in our models ranged from 0.76 for brittle stars in sediment to 0.91 for cup corals. An AUC value above 0.7 is an acceptable level of performance, between 0.8 and 0.9 is excellent, and above 0.9 is outstanding. We developed predictive maps of probability of occurrence using our validated models and a seafloor character map based on fine-scale (2?5 m) data. Cup corals and hydroids had high predicted probabilities of occurrence in areas of hard substrata, while short and tall sea pens were predicted to occur in parts of the SBC that had unconsolidated and mixed sediment. Our model predicted that brittle stars would occur throughout the entire channel on various bottom types. The combination of high-resolution seafloor character maps and predictive models of invertebrate distributions will aid managers in identifying habitats of particular concern and areas with vulnerable, deep-sea corals. Our models will be useful for marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, as well as for assessing the effectiveness of essential fish habitat closures and other marine protected areas.},

  abstract  = {Linking dispersal and range expansion of invasive species has long challenged theoretical and quantitative ecologists. Subtle differences in dispersal can yield large differences in geographic spread, with speeds ranging from constant to rapidly increasing. We developed a stage-structured integrodifference equation (IDE) model of the California sea otter range expansion that occurred between 1914 and 1986. The non-spatial model, a linear matrix population model, was coupled to a suite of candidate dispersal kernels to form stage-structured IDEs. Demographic and dispersal parameters were estimated independent of range expansion data. Using a single dispersal parameter, [alpha], we examined how well these stage-structured IDEs related small scale demographic and dispersal processes with geographic population expansion. The parameter [alpha] was estimated by fitting the kernels to dispersal data and by fitting the IDE model to range expansion data. For all kernels, the [alpha] estimate from range expansion data fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the [alpha] estimate from dispersal data. The IDE models with exponentially bounded kernels predicted invasion velocities that were captured within the 95% confidence bounds on the observed northbound invasion velocity. However, the exponentially bounded kernels yielded range expansions that were in poor qualitative agreement with range expansion data. An IDE model with fat (exponentially unbounded) tails and accelerating spatial spread yielded the best qualitative match. This model explained 94% and 97% of the variation in northbound and southbound range expansions when fit to range expansion data. These otters may have been fat-tailed accelerating invaders or they may have followed a piece-wise linear spread first over kelp forests and then over sandy habitats. Further, habitat-specific dispersal data could resolve these explanations.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in population genomics have made it possible to detect previously unidentified structure, obtain more accurate estimates of demographic parameters, and explore adaptive divergence, potentially revolutionizing the way genetic data are used to manage wild populations. Here, we identified 10Â 944 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to explore population structure, demography, and adaptive divergence in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from western Alaska. Patterns of population structure were similar to those of past studies, but our ability to assign individuals back to their region of origin was greatly improved (>90% accuracy for all populations). We also calculated effective size with and without removing physically linked loci identified from a linkage map, a novel method for nonmodel organisms. Estimates of effective size were generally above 1000 and were biased downward when physically linked loci were not removed. Outlier tests based on genetic differentiation identified 733 loci and three genomic regions under putative selection. These markers and genomic regions are excellent candidates for future research and can be used to create high-resolution panels for genetic monitoring and population assignment. This work demonstrates the utility of genomic data to inform conservation in highly exploited species with shallow population structure.},

  abstract  = {An extensive array of gene frequency data for 18 polymorphic genetic systems has been extracted from Mourant et al. (1976), representing more than 178 human tribes or nationalities from six major geographic groups, each divided into regional subgroups. Estimates have been derived of the proportion of genes at these loci that differ in two randomly chosen individuals within the same tribe or nationality, by comparison with two individuals chosen from different tribes within the same region, from different regions within the same geographic group, or from different geographic groups. The formulas necessary for calculation of these proportions for genotypic arrays which are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are given. This measure of genetic distance has the advantages of being readily interpreted by biologist and layman alike, being equally applicable to comparisons within and between populations, and being completely model free. The major component of genetic diversity as measured by this statistic falls within populations, accounting for 83.8% ± 2.8% of the total variation within the species. This conclusion is almost identical to that reached by Lewontin (1972) from an analysis based on the Shannon information measure. A study of the variation within each of the six geographic groups has demonstrated a significantly higher level of genetic variability in the Caucasian groups (Europe, Near East and Indian region) than in Africa, East Asia, America, and Oceania, amounting to a 22% increase at the between-region level. For each geographic group except Oceania, the component of variation between populations within a region has in addition been shown to be far greater than that due to differences between regions within a group. Finally, an analysis of all 15 pairwise comparisons among the geographic groups has shown the genetic divergence between major racial groups to be no more than a modest extension of the differences to be found between regions of the same group, accounting for only 51.6 ± 5.1% of the total between-population diversity.},

MPAs based on our most cost-effective scenario would deliver conservation benefits nearly 2.5 times greater than those from equivalent-sized areas recently implemented at the request of fishers, and at lower cost to them. Such results demonstrate the power of quantitative, knowledge-based prioritization approaches, which can be applied at high resolution and at oceanic scales.},

  abstract  = {We analysed relationships between demersal fish species richness, environment and trawl characteristics using an extensive collection of trawl data from the oceans around New Zealand. Analyses were carried out using both generalised additive models and boosted regression trees (sometimes referred to as "stochastic gradient boosting"). Depth was the single most important environmental predictor of variation in species richness, with highest richness occurring at depths of 900 to 1000 m, and with a broad plateau of moderately high richness between 400 and 1100 m. Richness was higher both in waters with high surface concentrations of chlorophyll a and in zones of mixing of water bodies of contrasting origins. Local variation in temperature was also important, with lower richness occurring in waters that were cooler than expected given their depth. Variables describing trawl length, trawl speed, and cod-end mesh size made a substantial contribution to analysis outcomes, even though functions fitted for trawl distance and cod-end mesh size were constrained to reflect the known performance of trawl gear. Species richness declined with increasing cod-end mesh size and increasing trawl speed, but increased with increasing trawl distance, reaching a plateau once trawl distances exceed about 3 nautical miles. Boosted regression trees provided a powerful analysis tool, giving substantially superior predictive performance to generalized additive models, despite the fitting of interaction terms in the latter.},

We analyse data on the incidental mortality of dolphins in the purse-seine fishery for tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The goal is to identify those rare purse-seine sets for which incidental mortality would be expected but none was reported. The ensemble method random forests is used to classify sets according to whether mortality was (response 1) or was not (response 0) reported. To identify questionable reporting practice, we construct ‘residuals’ as the difference between the categorical response (0,1) and the proportion of trees in the forest that classify a given set as having mortality. Two uses of these residuals to identify suspicious data are illustrated. This approach shows promise as a means of identifying suspect data gathered for environmental monitoring.},

OPRAH combines species landscape configuration preferences and habitat quality information to optimally select habitat restoration priorities for single or multiple species. OPRAH uses a simulated annealing algorithm and information about extant native vegetation, land use and rehabilitation costs, to find solutions to non-linear landscape-scale problems. The landscape is divided into planning units, some of which represent native vegetation, while others can be restored for a given budget. A habitat restoration problem for declining woodland bird species is demonstrated as a case study.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been well established that sponges play an important role in benthic ecology as abundant, large, sessile filter-feeders. However, the ecology of one group, the Hexactinellida, whose electrophysiology and cell biology is quite distinct from other Porifera, has received little attention due to the inaccessibility of their preferred deep water habitat. Now, a three year study of a population of the hexactinellid sponge Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni (Lambe, 1892) has been carried out in the fjords of British Columbia, Canada. Rhabdocalyptus was found to have a patchy distribution in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, with local abundance reaching 5.3 22 individuals m . The mean length of the tube-like sponges in the inlet was 32 cm (an equivalent of 5.8 l volume) although sponges could reach 87 cm in length (36 l volume). The average growth 21 21 rate of sponges measured over the course of 3 years was 1.98 cm year (min. 20.76 cm year, 21 21 21 21 max. 5.7 cm year ) or 167 ml year (min. 2537 ml year , max. 856 ml year ). The rate of 2 21 tissue regeneration after artificial wounding in the field was 0.0560.03 cm day , some 40 times the rate of growth. No recruitment was observed during the study, but mortality of large individuals was seen. Using the calculated growth rate (average rate of increase in volume), the age of an average-sized sponge was estimated to be 35 years. With the assumption that growth rate is constant, large individuals (1 m in length) were estimated to be 220 years old. All sponges showed seasonal trends in sloughing of the debris-covered outer spicules during winter months (November to February). Increase in outer spicule coat occurred from March to October and sloughing corresponded to the end of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in October or November. These data suggest that hexactinellid sponges have life history strategies and growth rates similar to those of massive tropical and temperate demosponges and that, despite their deep water habitat, they experience seasonality which influences their growth rates and perhaps reproductive period.},

  abstract  = {Landscape ecology has generated much excitement in the past two decades. One reason was that it brought spatial analysis and modeling to the forefront of ecological research. However, high expectations for landscape analysis to improve our understanding and prediction of ecological processes have largely been unfulfilled. We identified three kinds of critical issues: conceptual flaws in landscape pattern analysis, inherent limitations of landscape indices, and improper use of pattern indices. For example, many landscape analyses treat quantitative description of spatial pattern as an end itself and fail to explore relationships between pattern and process. Landscape indices and map data are sometimes used without testing their ecological relevance, which may not only confound interpretation of results, but also lead to meaningless results. In addition, correlation analysis with indices is impeded by the lack of data because of difficulties in large-scale experimentation and by complicated behavior of indices because of their varying responses to changes in scale and spatial pattern. These problems represent significant challenges to landscape pattern analysis, especially in terms of relating pattern to process. In this perspective paper, we examine the underlying problems of these challenges and offer some solutions.},

Following a random sampling procedure, 187 holes were drilled into the ice, and 234 sturgeon were counted and video-recorded. We found that sturgeon concentrated in a 2 ha area at the confluence of the Kennebecasis and Hammond rivers on a flat sandy substrate at a depth of 3.1–6.9 m. Generalized linear models were developed to describe the relationship of shortnose sturgeon density and habitat variables. The model indicated that the shortnose sturgeon had significant preference to deeper areas within this region. The total abundance of shortnose sturgeon in the area was estimated to be 4836 ± 69 (mean ± standard error) using the ordinary kriging method to interpolate sturgeon density at unsampled sites. This overwintering habitat of shortnose sturgeon can be defined as critical habitat following the identification policies of the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA).},

In this study, we examined the accuracy of estimates of catch derived from an observer survey of retained and discarded catches in a multispecies fish trawl fishery off the coast of NSW, Australia. Observer-based estimates of magnitudes and size-distributions of retained catches were compared with independent, unbiased estimates that were available for a subset of species (species managed by catch quotas) caught in the fishery. Conclusions about bias in estimates of other components of catch (especially discards) are based on the premise that bias is unlikely to affect these estimates without also affecting estimates of retained catches of quota species. We conclude that estimates of catch, based on the 3-year period 1993-1995, were unaffected by significant bias. Observer-based estimates of magnitudes of retained catches did not differ significantly from reported landings for 6 out of 7 species and the combined catch of quota species (CQS) for the Ulladulla fleet, 11 out of 11 species and CQS for the Eden fleet and 10 out of 11 species and CQS for the 2 fleets combined. There was, however, some evidence of bias in estimates of catch for each fleet in I of the 3 years. Observer-based size-distributions were not significantly biased. We conclude that our approach to validating observer-based estimates of catch would also be of use in observer surveys of other fisheries.},

We used a subset of these data collected between 16 and 29 September to investigate whether this sampling protocol was justified based on temporal variation in the salmon migration data. During post-processing, the 20-min sequence was split into two 10-min periods and the number of migrating salmon was counted separately. Cross- and autocorrelation analysis showed that estimates from the first and second 10-min samples were similar (r = 0.65) and variation between them (i.e., within the hour) was random, supporting the conclusion that systematic-hourly sampling is a defensible sampling design for acoustic enumeration when temporal variation in fish migration is unknown a priori. Using a simple benefitâ€“cost model (statistical reliability of point estimates of salmon escapementâ€“sampling effort), we recommend a minimum sampling effort of 10-min hâˆ’1 and a maximum effort of 20-min hâˆ’1 for projects using a systematic sampling scheme in which the goal is to estimate total upstream salmon escapement. An alternative sampling approach targets high-passage events such as diurnal peaks or periods when total daily upstream escapement exceeds 25 000 fish dâˆ’1, for increased sampling effort while reducing sampling effort during low-passage periods. This design will improve the statistical reliability of the resulting point estimates of upstream escapement relative to that achievable with a systematic effort with no overall change in total sampling effort over the course of the migration period.},

  Abstract                 = {We conducted a field-based test of the widely available generic computer simulation model VORTEX for population viability analysis (PVA). The model was used to predict the abundance of three species of arboreal marsupials in a system of 39 remnant patches of Eucalyptus forest embedded within a 5050-ha area of exotic radiata pine (Pinus radiata) forest in southeastern Australia. The marsupial species were: greater glider (Petauroides volans), mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus caninus), and common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus). Predictions were generated for scenarios in which: (1) the rate of exchange of animals between patches was varied, (2) different models for the migration of animals between habitat patches were invoked, (3) different levels of immigration (or dispersal) from a large, neighboring source area were simulated, (4) variations in habitat quality between remnant patches were incorporated in the model, and (5) the influence of the pine matrix surrounding the remnant patches was modeled. These predictions were then compared with the results of extensive field-based spotlighting surveys to estimate abundance and patch occupancy of arboreal marsupials in the remnant system.
Models in which the carrying capacity of remnants was assumed to be a simple function of patch area and home range size substantially overpredicted the number of occupied patches and total abundance of animals. Only when model complexity was increased, by incorporating effects of within-patch habitat quality based on dominant forest type together with negative effects of the surrounding pine matrix on dispersal mortality, was better congruence obtained between predictions from VORTEX and observed values for patch occupancy and overall animal abundance.
We knew the size, spatial location, and interpatch distances for all of the eucalypt remnants, as well as the precise time they were fragmented, information that is unavailable for the vast majority of human-modified landscapes. The biology and ecology of the three target species also were well known. Even though our studies were underpinned by extensive background information, accurate matching of model predictions to field data was possible only with a posteriori selection from an array of plausible scenarios of dispersal patterns and rates. Hence, an important over-arching conclusion from our results is that conservation biologists should be cautious in predicting the actual dynamics and response of populations in fragmented systems, even relatively simple well-known ones.},

Starting in late 1994, the closed area excluded all bottom tending fishing gear capable of capturing demersal fishes. A total of 32 stations were selected inside and outside of the closed area in sand habitats. Video and still photographic transects were conducted at each station using the Seabed Observation and Sampling System (SEABOSS). Seven common (i.e. featureless sand, rippled sand, sand with emergent fauna, bare gravelly sand, gravelly sand with attached-erect fauna, whole shell, shell fragment) and 2 rare (sponges, biogenic depressions) microhabitat types were compared separately. Results showed significant differences in the relative abundance of the shell fragment and sponge microhabitat types between fished and unfished areas. The lack of differences for the other microhabitats may indicate that the level of fishing activity in the area is matched by the system's ability to recover.},

  Abstract                 = {The random-walk-with-drift model of population dynamics is an important tool in conservation biology, partly because its parameters are easily estimated from periodic observations of population size. Estimating the model with noisy data is problematic, however, because the commonly used estimators of process variation are biased if population abundance measurements are imprecise, and a recently developed method that attempts to remove this bias is not robust. In this paper, I show how the random-walk-with-drift model can be applied to noisy time series of population estimates by converting the random-walk-with-drift model to state-space form and applying the Kalman filter to yield the likelihood of the data. The likelihood function allows the variances of the process error and measurement error and the growth rate of the population to be estimated in a way that is robust and fully supported by statistical theory. Comparative analysis using simulated data indicates that the Kalman-filter method reduces the bias in estimates of process variance without yielding negative variance estimates. I apply the method to California sea otter and Yellowstone grizzly bear data to illustrate how the method (and simple extensions) can be used to assess the status of real populations. California sea otters appear to have little risk of extinction over the next 100 years although the population may not be secure over the long term if a recent apparent cessation of population growth persists. The grizzly bear population appears to have responded positively to the 1988 Yellowstone fires, and if the population continues to grow at the average rate observed over the study period, it is extremely unlikely to go extinct.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessing the potential for threatened species to persist and spread within fragmented landscapes requires the identification of core areas that can sustain resident populations and dispersal corridors that can link these core areas with isolated patches of remnant habitat. We developed a set of GIS tools, simulation methods, and network analysis procedures to assess potential landscape connectivity for the Delmarva fox squirrel (DFS; Sciurus niger cinereus), an endangered species inhabiting forested areas on the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. Information on the DFS’s life history and dispersal characteristics, together with data on the composition and configuration of land cover on the peninsula, were used as input data for an individual-based model to simulate dispersal patterns of millions of squirrels. Simulation results were then assessed using methods from graph theory, which quantifies habitat attributes associated with local and global connectivity. Several bottlenecks to dispersal were identified that were not apparent from simple distance-based metrics, highlighting specific locations for landscape conservation, restoration, and/or squirrel translocations. Our approach links simulation models, network analysis, and available field
data in an efficient and general manner, making these methods useful and appropriate for assessing the movement dynamics of threatened species within landscapes being altered by human and natural disturbances.},

  Abstract                 = {The spread of the California sea otter population provides excellent material for studying the spread of an invading species because the data are not confounded by spread in multiple spatial dimensions. We analyze data on the range expansion of the California sea otter within the context of a classical mathematical model incorporating growth, diffusion, and advection. Classical theory predicts that population fronts will form, that asymptotic rates of advance will be constant within homogeneous habitat, and that these asymptotic rates are given by twice the square root of the product of two factors, the intrinsic rate of increase and the diffusion coefficient. These patterns were observed in the historical data for range expansion of the otter, and the central remaining problem is explaining the observed differences in the rate of spread between the northern and southern fronts. Our analysis suggests that advection plays, at most, a minor role in those differences and, moreover, that estimated differences in the diffusion coefficients are sufficient to account for the observed patterns. Habitat-dependent differences in mortality seem to present the major competing hypothesis, and we regard as quite reasonable the possibility that both factors contribute to the observed differences. Further studies should be undertaken to provide the independent parameters necessary to resolve the issue and permit testing and further application of the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous methods have been proposed for enhancing species viability. Much attention has been given to the minimum required number of individuals, size and number of nature reserves, and value of habitat corridors. Surprisingly, however, the po- tential value of active management of a population through a program of translocations has only rarely been suggested, and explicit formulations of a theoretical basis for such a program are nonexistent. By drawing on the mathematical optimization technique known as dynamic programming, I develop an optimal dynamic strategy for translocation in a model population. I demonstrate this approach using a simple model for a hypothetical remnant population with two available habitat reserves incorporating demographic, envi- ronmental, and catastrophic forms of stochasticity. I then generalize the results by examining the effect on the cost and effectiveness of optimal translocation management of reserve size, population growth rate, environmental stochasticity, catastrophe size and frequency, translocation mortality rate, spatial correlation of population dynamics, and reserve size asymmetry. Simulated application of the optimal strategies, under a wide range of condi- tions, demonstrates that managed translocations averaging between 1 and 6 individuals/yr might dramatically enhance the probability of species persistence and reduce the required size of nature reserves, potentially by >1 order of magnitude. Given prohibitive financial and political costs of land acquisition for nature reserves, this technique could provide an important alternative for saving many endangered species.},

  Abstract                 = {This report provides an overview of physical and biological ecosystems in the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA). PNCIMA is one of several Large Ocean Management Areas created for ecosystem based management of human use in marine areas by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. PNCIMA includes the Pacific coast of British Columbia from the Canada-Alaska border in the north to Brooks Peninsula on NW Vancouver Island and Quadra Island and Bute Inlet in the south; from the outer limit of the continental slope in the west to the coastal watersheds in the east.
PNCIMA is characterized by steep and rugged coastal mountains, abundant offshore islands, a coastline dominated by rocky shores with few sand and gravel beaches, valleys and fjords that extend to the ocean floor, and a glacially scoured continental shelf with cross cutting troughs. The Pacific Ocean moderates the climate, resulting in warm wet winters and cool summers. PNCIMA is located in a transition zone between two areas, one dominated by Alaska Coastal Current downwelling (north), and the other by California Current upwelling (south). PNCIMA’s semi-enclosed basin, varied bottom topography, and freshwater input set it apart from other areas of the North American west coast. The troughs and steep edges influence, and likely enhance, plankton and fish production. Strong tidal mixing in the narrow passes and channels enhances productivity around the periphery.
The overall trophic structure of the PNCIMA region appears to be relatively robust to reduction or elimination of single components in the food web, as long as other species occur within the same functional group. However, trophic pathways to individual species may be more constrained; it is unknown which species may be critically sensitive to the reduction or elimination of other species. Existing data suggests that the trophic structure is largely controlled by “bottom-up” forcing.
The ecosystem receives a large biomass of migratory species: stop-over migrants, such as Pacific salmon and marine migratory birds; destination migrants such as whales; and environmental migrants such as pelagic zooplankton and fish that enter PNCIMA when conditions are unusually warm. Migrants provide an input of energy and food, but also can export energy from the system, as in Pacific salmon’s transfer of energy and nutrients from marine to terrestrial coastal ecosystems.
Habitat use for many large and/or commercial marine species found within PNCIMA is summarized, including significant nearshore and biologically productive pelagic habitats. Eleven appendices detail our current state of knowledge for the geology, meteorology and climate, physical and chemical oceanography, plankton, marine plants, invertebrates, groundfish, pelagic fishes, Pacific salmon, marine mammals and turtles, and sea birds in PNCIMA.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty about ecological variables can affect risk designations for species at risk of extinction. This study evaluated the effect of quantitatively characterizing ecological uncertainty on species at risk decision-making, using the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as a case study. Fifty senior authors of COSEWIC assessments of vertebrate species were invited to use a confidential web-based survey to quantitatively characterize uncertainty in their expert opinions for 17 COSEWIC ecological variables. Probability distributions for the 17 variables provided by each of 16/50 (32.0%) respondents were used with Monte Carlo sampling to generate sets of point estimates used as input for a computer algorithm that emulated COSEWIC decision-making for risk designation. The effect of uncertainty on risk designation was measured as a Monte Carlo-generated probability for the same risk designation as that determined by the mean point estimates only. Analysis of uncertainty revealed plausible alternative designations for seven of the 16 species. Although the majority of these cases were affected in a relatively minor way, there were cases where the explicit characterization of uncertainty caused major differences in risk designation. From these results, it can be concluded that characterization of uncertainty can have important effects on species at risk decision-making. Responsible agencies should explicitly incorporate uncertainty in their decision-making by (1) requiring explicit characterization of uncertainty for input ecological variables and output risk designations and (2) developing rational methods to incorporate the uncertainty in decision-making.},

We tested the significance of different measures of water temperature, discharge, fish abundance, and entry timing for forecasting discrepancies between lower-river and upriver escapement estimates using multiple regressions of principal component scores. Descriptive discrepancy models (i.e., ‘‘management adjustment’’ models) identified using Akaike’s information criterion were consistent with the known biology of each group. For example, temperature and discharge thresholds were selected for early Stuart run discrepancy models, reflecting the extremes in both variables experienced by these early migrants. Predictive discrepancy models were also generated for each run timing group by using the limited number of environmental variables that are available in-season to fisheries managers. Even predictive discrepancy models using simple environmental metrics of average river temperature, flow, and river entry timing provide a valuable tool for forecasting relative indices of spawning migration mortality. This study provides an example of how environmentally based predictive tools can be used to inform fisheries management decisions and improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to the need for overt recognition of uncertainty in management of natural resources, we present a new, innovative, causal approach for analysis of stock-recruitment relationships and prediction of recruitment. Applying principles and techniques developed from the theory of fuzzy sets, we demonstrate how heuristic reasoning can be used to define stock-recruitment relationships, explicitly characterise vagueness and uncertainty, and provide a functional relationship that combines stock size and past recruitment to predict future recruitment. The approach is termed model-free estimation or approximation. Tested on eight stock-recruitment data sets, there was no significant difference between recruitment predicted by the fuzzy approximation method and the Ricker or Beverton-Holt recruitment functions. We account for effects of nonstationarity by incorporating rules that relate past recruitment to future recruitment in the fuzzy stock-recruitment system. A weighting factor, w, represents the degree of belief in the importance of past recruitment and stock size in predicting future recruitment. The approach is robust with respect to the number of fuzzy sets used to define data clusters, can be tailored to individual circumstances, and thrives in data-poor situations where analytical methods may be inappropriate. It is a simple and broadly applicable solution with important implications for fish stock assessment and fisheries management in general.},

Location State of Vaud, western Switzerland. 
MethodsGeneralized additive models (GAMs) were fitted using the grasp package (generalized regression analysis and spatial predictions, http://www.cscf.ch/grasp). Results Model selection based on cross-validation appeared to be the best compromise between model stability and performance (parsimony) among the five methods tested. Weighting absences returned models that perform better than models fitted with the original sample prevalence. This appeared to be mainly due to the impact of very low prevalence values on evaluation statistics. Removing zeroes beyond the range of presences on main environmental gradients changed the set of selected predictors, and potentially their response curve shape. Moreover, removing zeroes slightly improved model performance and stability when compared with the baseline model on the same data set. Incorporating a spatial trend predictor improved model performance and stability significantly. Even better models were obtained when including local spatial autocorrelation. A novel approach to include interactions proved to be an efficient way to account for interactions between all predictors at once. 
Main conclusions Models and spatial predictions of 18 forest communities were significantly improved by using either: (1) cross-validation as a model selection method, (2) weighted absences, (3) limited absences, (4) predictors accounting for spatial autocorrelation, or (5) a factor variable accounting for interactions between all predictors. The final choice of model strategy should depend on the nature of the available data and the specific study aims. Statistical evaluation is useful in searching for the best modelling practice. However, one should not neglect to consider the shapes and interpretability of response curves, as well as the resulting spatial predictions in the final assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {Long, linear furrows of lengths up to several kilometres were observed during a recent high-resolution, multi-beam bathymetry survey of Jeffreys Ledge, a prominent fishing ground in the Gulf of Maine located about So km from Portsmouth, NH, USA. These features, which have a relief of only a few centimetres, are presumed to be caused either directly by dredging gear used in the area for scallop and clam fisheries, or indirectly through the dragging of boulders by bottom gear. Extraction of these features with very small vertical expression from a noisy data set, including several instrumental artefacts, presented a number of challenges. To enhance the detection and identification of the features, data artefacts were identified and removed selectively using spatial frequency filtering. Verification of the presence of the features was carried out with repeated multi-beam bathymetry surveys and sidescan sonar surveys. Seabed marks that were clearly detected on multi-beam and sidescan sonar records were not discernible on a subsequent video survey. The inability to see the seabed marks with video may be related to their age. The fact that with time, the textural contrasts discernible by video imagery are lost has important ramifications for the appropriateness of methodologies for quantifying gear impact. The results imply that detailed investigations of seabed impact are best done with a suite of survey tools (multi-beam bathymetry, sidescan sonar, and video) and software to integrate the disparate data sets geographically.},

  abstract  = {Ranch-reared mink (Mustela vison) were used as a model in an experimental trial to investigate the potential effects of exposure to two petroleum products on sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Mink were exposed either dermally on one occasion 60 days prior to breeding or via low level contamination of their diets daily from 60 days prior to breeding (January 1994) until weaning of kits (June 1994). For dermal exposure, we placed mink in either a slick of Alaskan North Slope crude oil (n = 24) or bunker C fuel oil (n = 24) on sea water or sea water alone (n = 10) for 1 min. For dietary exposure, we fed mink rations containing 500 ppm of either Alaskan North Slope crude oil (n = 24) or bunker C fuel oil (n = 24; control, n = 15). The number of liveborn kits did not differ significantly among mink exposed dermally (5.0 kits/female for crude oil and 6.5 kits/female for bunker C fuel oil) and unexposed controls (5.3 kits/female). However, only 2.3 and 0.7 kits were produced per female for those exposed through the diet to crude oil and bunker C fuel oil, respectively. Females with reduced reproductive success had no clinical signs of toxicosis or behavioral abnormalities. In addition, kits of females exposed through the diet had poor survival to weaning. Once mature, kits born to females exposed to bunker C fuel oil in the diet had significantly reduced reproductive success (3.4 kits/female) although their only exposure to the petroleum products was in utero or during nursing. Therefore, it is possible that sea otter populations consuming contaminated food sources or colonizing previously oiled habitats will have reduced reproductive success.},

  Abstract                 = {A method of sensitivity analysis for population viability models is presented that uses logistic regression to evaluate the importance of model parameters that influence the risks of extinction. This approach is used to evaluate the importance of fecundity parameters and the initial number of non-breeding birds in a stochastic stage-structured model of helmeted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix population dynamics. The regression analysis indicates which model parameters have the greatest impact on the risk of population decline. The results demonstrate that a simple expression containing the parameters of the model can encapsulate predictions of risk. This technique is proposed as an efficient alternative method of sensitivity analysis for population viability models. Of four fecundity parameters, the mean fecundity of intact pairs had the greatest influence on the risks faced by the helmeted honeyeater population. Mean fecundity of split pairs and the sex ratio of offspring were also important parameters. Over the range of parameters considered in this paper, environmental variation in fecundity and the initial number of non-breeding birds had little influence on the risks of decline. The importance of interactions between parameters was analysed.},

We propose that risks of decline may be usefully summarized by the expected minimum population size. This is the smallest population size that is expected to occur within a particular time period. Analytical solutions for the expected minimum population size are obtained for a stochastic population model of exponential growth. In more complex models that are analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation, the expected minimum population size may be determined by recording the smallest population size obtained in each iteration and taking the average of these values. Whereas risks of decline change abruptly with changes in parameter values, the expected minimum population size changes more gradually. The results demonstrate that the expected minimum population size provides a better indication of the propensity for decline than the risk of extinction (or risk of decline to some other small population size), especially when the risk of extinction is small.},

  Abstract                 = {* 1Factors that have been considered when deciding how to invest resources in conservation of species include the efficacy and cost of management, the importance of the species, the level of threat, and the timeframe over which results are to be achieved. However, it is unclear how each of these different factors should be weighted and combined when making a decision. 
* 2 We examine how the probabilities of species changing in IUCN Red List categories are influenced by expenditure of resources. We use these relationships to determine optimal investment strategies, using Australian birds as a case study. 
* 3The optimal level of investment in different species depends critically on whether managers wish to minimize the number of extinct species or a weighted average of all threatened species, and on the available budget. The level of investment should not necessarily reflect the level of threat. In our case study, the timeframe of management had little influence on the investment decision. 
* 4 Our results show that extinctions of Australian birds can be largely avoided over the next 80 years given current expenditure, but greater investment in conservation is required to reduce the number of threatened species. 
* 5 Synthesis and applications. The most efficient allocation of resources to conserve species is difficult to determine intuitively; therefore, this decision demands the use of formal decision theory. The influence of the particular management objective on the optimal decision means that this feature needs careful consideration. Our approach can be used to determine the level of investment that is required to reduce the number of threatened species.},

  Abstract                 = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management. Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.},

While river lengths are readily available, representative widths, necessary for area calculations, are difficult to obtain. As field surveys to collect this information are resource intensive, a predictive model was developed to enable the calculation of river wetted width using GIS-derived values for catchment and river descriptors. A model containing upstream catchment area and the Shreve river drainage network index accounted for 88% of the variation in field measured river wetted width. Comparisons in Irish and Scottish rivers between modelled and measured widths were highly correlated and suggest that the model may be transferable to neighbouring geographic areas. As an example, the model is applied to provide an estimate of the usable fluvial habitat available to Atlantic salmon in Ireland.},

  Abstract                 = {Many endangered species laws provide exceptions to legislated prohibitions through incidental take provisions as long as take is the result of unintended consequences of an otherwise legal activity. These allowances presumably invoke the theory of demographic compensation, commonly applied to harvested species, by allowing limited harm as long as the probability of the species' survival or recovery is not reduced appreciably. Demographic compensation requires some density-dependent limits on survival or reproduction in a species' annual cycle that can be alleviated through incidental take. Using a population model for piping plovers in the Great Plains, we found that when the population is in rapid decline or when there is no density dependence, the probability of quasi-extinction increased linearly with increasing take. However, when the population is near stability and subject to density-dependent survival, there was no relationship between quasi-extinction probability and take rates. We note however, that a brief examination of piping plover demography and annual cycles suggests little room for compensatory capacity. We argue that a population's capacity for demographic compensation of incidental take should be evaluated when considering incidental allowances because compensation is the only mechanism whereby a population can absorb the negative effects of take without incurring a reduction in the probability of survival in the wild. With many endangered species there is probably little known about density dependence and compensatory capacity. Under these circumstances, using multiple system models (with and without compensation) to predict the population's response to incidental take and implementing follow-up monitoring to assess species response may be valuable in increasing knowledge and improving future decision making.},

A previous mitochondrial DNA study, while revealing a high degree of genetic variation within the species, did not resolve the level of population sub-division expected for this anadromous fish. Two microsatellite loci were developed from eulachon DNA and, in addition to three microsatellite loci from the rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax, were employed as a class of "higher resolution" markers in an attempt to further resolve the population structure of eulachon. The level of genetic variation observed at these loci was surprisingly low (heterozygosity ranged from 4% to 64%; number of alleles ranged from three to ten; maximum size range of alleles was 16 base pairs), yet revealed the greater power of microsatellites over mitochondrial DNA for resolving population sub-division within eulachon. More pairwise population comparisons were significant with the microsatellite data, and the microsatellite FST value was twice the value observed with mtDNA (mtDNA FST=0.023; microsatellite FST=0.045). Despite this greater sensitivity, it was difficult to define distinct demographic units in eulachon, a species which is currently the focus of conservation concern. Eulachon highlight the challenges of examining population structure in species with inferred high gene flow.},

  abstract  = {Due to the apparent decline in size of a number of populations, eulachon, Thaleichthys pacificus, have recently become the focus of a conservation movement in the northeast Pacific. Little is known of the marine life-history phase of this anadromous fish, and although it has been suggested that eulachon spawning in different rivers may form distinct populations, nothing is known of their population structure. Molecular genetic data were used to investigate population structure and possible management schemes. Mitochondrial DNA genotypes, determined through restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis, were resolved in fish from several rivers throughout the geographical range of eulachon. Our data support the idea that extant eulachon populations result from postglacial dispersal from a single Wisconsinan glacial refuge. Further, while three of the 37 haplotypes recovered account for approximately 79% of the samples, many private haplotypes were observed, suggesting possible regional population structure. While a great deal of genetic variation was observed (37 haplotypes in 315 samples), an amova showed that >Â 97% of the total variation was detected within populations. As yet, it is unclear whether genetically distinct populations of eulachon exist, or if these fish may be treated as one or a few large populations. Results were tested against predictions made from hypotheses concerning the origin and persistence of subdivided populations in marine species, and seem to be more consistent with the Memberâ€“Vagrant hypothesis than isolation by distance. Eulachon present an interesting situation that illustrates the difficulties involved in defining management units in organisms with high levels of gene flow.},

Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

A principle challenge of predicting effects of proposed management, development, or conservation actions is the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including land-use and climate change, that interact to affect wildlife habitat and populations through time. Here we demonstrate how models of land-use, climate change, and other dynamic factors can be integrated into a coherent framework for predicting wildlife population trends. Our framework starts with land-use and climate change models developed for a region of interest. Vegetation changes through time under alternative future scenarios are predicted using an individual-based plant community model. These predictions are combined with spatially explicit animal habitat models to map changes in the distribution and quality of wildlife habitat expected under the various scenarios. Animal population responses to habitat changes and other factors are then projected using a flexible, individual-based animal population model.},

  abstract  = {Aim: Conservation planning exercises increasingly rely on species distributions predicted either from one particular statistical model or, more recently, from an ensemble of models (i.e. ensemble forecasting). However, it has not yet been explored how different ways of summarizing ensemble predictions affect conservation planning outcomes. We evaluate these effects and compare commonplace consensus methods, applied before the conservation prioritization phase, to a novel method that applies consensus after reserve selection.

Location: Europe.

Methods: We used an ensemble of predicted distributions of 146 Western Palaearctic bird species in alternative ways: four different consensus methods, as well as distributions discounted with variability, were used to produce inputs for spatial conservation prioritization. In addition, we developed and tested a novel method, in which we built 100 datasets by sampling the ensemble of predicted distributions, ran a conservation prioritization analysis on each of them and averaged the resulting priority ranks. We evaluated the conservation outcome against three controls: (i) a null control, based on random ranking of cells; (2) the reference solution, based on an expert-refined dataset; and (3) the independent solution, based on an independent dataset.

Results: Networks based on predicted distributions were more representative of rare species than randomly selected networks. Alternative methods to summarize ensemble predictions differed in representativeness of resulting reserve networks. Our novel method resulted in better representation of rare species than pre-selection consensus methods.

Main conclusions: Retaining information about the variation in the predicted distributions throughout the conservation prioritization seems to provide better results than summarizing the predictions before conservation prioritization. Our results highlight the need to understand and consider model-based uncertainty when using predicted distribution data in conservation prioritization.},

  abstract  = {The mortality of juveniles of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus and related physiological responses (osmoregulation and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) gene expression) were studied in a simulated field salinity decrease after a heavy rainfall in summer. Salinity firstly decreased gradually from 30 psu to 20 psu (S20) or 25 psu (S25) at a rate of 2.5 psu every 6 h, and then was maintained at 20 psu or 25 psu. After 96 h at the low salinities, salinity was increased gradually to 30 psu at a rate of 2.5 psu every 6 h, and then was maintained at 30 psu for 96 h. There was no mortality during salinity decreases, but 40%â€“50% mortality occurred when salinities were maintained at low levels. The osmotic pressure of the coelomic fluid changed with decrease in ambient salinity but stabilized within 6 h after the salinity change. In both S20 and S25 treatments, expression of hsp70 mRNA increased initially after salinity decrease, reached a maximum value at the lowest salinity and returned to the control level (without salinity decrease) after 72-h low-salinity exposure. These data suggest that low salinity can cause large-scale mortality of juvenile A. japonicus, which may be partly due to the rapid decrease of osmotic pressure in the coelomic fluid during hypo-osmotic stress. Furthermore, cellular level stress is indicated by up-regulation of mRNA for the molecular chaperone Hsp70, but this adaptive response can only provide temporary protection against salinity decrease.},

  Abstract                 = {We use population viability analysis of an endangered Florida scrub mint, Dicerandra frutescens, to specify the optimal fire return intervals for its long-term persistence and for its specific habitat. We derived 83 population projection matrices from 13 years of demographic data from eight populations, 59 matrices from scrub populations and 24 from firelane or yard edges. Seed dormancy and germination transitions were inferred based on experimental data and verified by comparing modeled vs. observed population trajectories. Finite rates of increase in scrub sites were highest shortly after fire and declined steeply through 10 years postfire. The break-even value of [lambda] = 1 was passed quickly, in about six years, suggesting that populations >6 years postfire were already facing decline. The decline is probably related to the rapid growth of competing shrubs in the habitat of D. frutescens. In long-unburned sites, finite rates of increase were nearly always <1 and declined the most in the long-unburned site with no foot trails or treefall gaps. Finite rates of increase in firelane populations also declined with years since fire or last disking. The yard edge population showed [lambda] values both >1 and <1, with no temporal trend. Stochastic simulations in scrub sites suggested an optimal regular fire return interval of about 6-12 years. Regular fires at this interval were more favorable than stochastic fire regimes, but stochasticity reduced extinction percentages at longer fire return intervals. Stochastic fire return intervals implied a wider optimal fire return interval of 6-21 years. We suggest that prescribed fire in Florida scrub on yellow sand has occurred (and needs to occur) more frequently than previously recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River are scheduled to be assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2013. Information on the spatial distribution of Sockeye salmon populations is required for COSEWIC quantitative criteria B and D. Fraser River sockeye populations have been organized into 24 Conservation Units (CUs) in support of Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s (DFO) Wild Salmon Policy. For each of the 24 CUs, we estimated: the number of spawning locations (defined as individual spawning streams or whole lakes or large branches of lakes); the extent of occurrence (defined as polygons encompassing all spawning areas in each CU); the area of occupancy (a measure of the habitat actually occupied for spawning, and assessed using grid techniques); and the biological area of occupancy (a measure of occupancy not constrained by grid methodology). We also estimated the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and biological area of occupancy for the entire distribution of Fraser River Sockeye salmon spawners. Estimates were based on observations of spawner distributions from 2008 to 2011. Data on the number of locations were available from 1992 to 2011, which allowed trends in spatial distribution to be examined. We identified spawning sites that contained potential vagrants, and evaluated the effect of removing these sites from all analyses. We explored a number of alternative means for calculating extent of occurrence and area of occupancy statistics, but found in most cases the method of analysis had little effect on the value of statistics relative to thresholds defined by COSEWIC.},

  Abstract                 = {Stock–recruit functions are important in fisheries stock assessment, but there is often uncertainty surrounding the appropriate stock–recruit model and its parameter values. Combining different stock–recruit data sets of related species through Bayesian hierarchical analysis can decrease these uncertainties and help to characterize appropriate stock–recruit forms and ranges of plausible parameter values. Two different stock–recruit functions (Beverton–Holt and Ricker) have been parameterized in terms of the steepness, which is a parameter that is comparable between populations. In the hierarchical analysis, the prior probability distribution of parameters for the cross-population variation in steepness is determined through a concise model structure. By calculating the Bayes’ posteriors for alternative model forms, model uncertainty is accounted for. This methodology has been applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stock–recruit data to provide predictions for the steepness of the stock–recruit function for Baltic salmon for which no stock–recruit data exist.},

  abstract  = {Kelp forests represent a major habitat type in coastal waters worldwide and their structure and distribution is predicted to change due to global warming. Despite their ecological and economical importance, there is still a lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea), the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18Â m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i.e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62% (LDA) and 68% (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75% (LDA) and 76% (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Discharge fluctuations in the St. Lawrence River (Canada) affect reproduction habitat for Northern pike ( Esox lucius Linnaeus). We developed a spatially explicit model for that large-scale river system to predict spawning habitat surfaces available for egg deposition and the potential mortality by dewatering occurring during the embryonic-larval stages. The spatial model used simulated current velocity, wetland type and water temperature at a high spatial resolution over the entire fluvial St. Lawrence River, Canada. Those three variables were integrated into a habitat suitability index (HSI) and weighted according to the literature. A new thermal preferendum curve, based on a field experiment, was included in the HSI, reflecting that the probability of observing pike spawners in a given area increased with temperature. The reproduction chronology was predicted every year with an original model based on air temperature in order to reconstitute the historic habitat surfaces for the period 1960-2000. The results revealed that discharge had a substantial effect on both suitable habitat for egg deposition and potential mortality following dewatering. The best and the largest spawning habitats were identified, as well as the most limiting regions in the river. The present findings have already been used to prepare a new discharge regulation plan for the Lake Ontario's St. Lawrence River system.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the use of using remotely sensed observation and full coverage hydroacoustic datasets to quantify habitat suitability for a marine demersal fish, the blue-throated wrasse. Because of issues surrounding the detection of species using remotely sensed video techniques, the application of presence-only techniques are well suited for modeling demersal fish habitat suitability. Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis is used to compare analyses conducted using seafloor variables derived from hydroacoustics at three spatial scales; fine (56.25 m2), medium (506.25 m2) and coarse (2756.25 m2), to determine which spatial scale was most influential in predicting blue-throated wrasse habitat suitability. The coarse scale model was found to have the best predictive capabilities with a Boyce Index of 0.80Â±0.26. The global marginality and specialization values indicated that, irrespective of spatial scale, blue-throated wrasse prefer seafloor characteristics that are different to the mean available within the study site, but exhibit a relatively wide niche. Although variable importance varied over the three spatial scale models, blue-throated wrasse showed a strong preference for regions of shallow water, close to reef, with high rugosity and maximum curvature and low HSI-B values. Generally the spatial patterns in habitat suitability were well represented in the Marine National Park compared to adjacent waters. However, some significant differences in spatial patterns were observed. Interspersion and Juxtaposition Indexes for unsuitable and highly suitable habitat were significantly smaller inside the Marine National Park, while the Mean Shape Index of unsuitable habitat in the Marine National Park was significantly larger.},

  abstract  = {Planning for resilience is the focus of many marine conservation programs and initiatives. These efforts aim to inform conservation strategies for marine regions to ensure they have inbuilt capacity to retain biological diversity and ecological function in the face of global environmental change – particularly changes in climate and resource exploitation. In the absence of direct biological and ecological information for many marine species, scientists are increasingly using spatially-explicit, predictive-modeling approaches. Through the improved access to multibeam sonar and underwater video technology these models provide spatial predictions of the most suitable regions for an organism at resolutions previously not possible. However, sensible-looking, well-performing models can provide very different predictions of distribution depending on which occurrence dataset is used. To examine this, we construct species distribution models for nine temperate marine sedentary fishes for a 25.7 km2 study region off the coast of southeastern Australia. We use generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM) and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to build models based on co-located occurrence datasets derived from two underwater video methods (i.e. baited and towed video) and fine-scale multibeam sonar based seafloor habitat variables. Overall, this study found that the choice of modeling approach did not considerably influence the prediction of distributions based on the same occurrence dataset. However, greater dissimilarity between model predictions was observed across the nine fish taxa when the two occurrence datasets were compared (relative to models based on the same dataset). Based on these results it is difficult to draw any general trends in regards to which video method provides more reliable occurrence datasets. Nonetheless, we suggest predictions reflecting the species apparent distribution (i.e. a combination of species distribution and the probability of detecting it). Consequently, we also encourage researchers and marine managers to carefully interpret model predictions.},

Our results show that sea otters in this area had decreased survival rates in the years following the spill and that the effects of the spill on annual survival increased rather than dissipated for older animals. Otters born after the 1989 spill were affected less than those alive in March 1989, but do show continuing negative effects through 1998. Population-wide effects of the spill appear to have slowly dissipated through time, due largely to the loss of cohorts alive during the spill. Our results demonstrate that the difficult-to-detect long-term impacts of environmental disasters may still be highly significant and can be rigorously analyzed by using a combination of population data, modeling techniques, and statistical analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {We contrasted body condition, and age-specific reproduction and mortality between a growing population of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) at Kodiak Island and a high-density near-equilibrium population at Amchitka Island, Alaska. We obtained data from marked individuals, population surveys, and collections of beach-cast carcasses. Mass:length ratios indicated that females (but not males) captured in 1992 at Amchitka were in poorer condition than those captured at Kodiak in 1986–1987. In 1993, the condition of females at Amchitka improved in apparent response to two factors: (1) an episodic influx of Pacific smooth lumpsuckers, Aptocyclus 6entricocus, from the epi-pelagic zone, which otters consumed; and (2) an increase in the otters’ benthic invertebrate prey resulting from declining otter numbers. Reproductive rates varied with age (0.37 [CI0.21 to 0.53] births female1 yr1 for 2–3-yr-olds, and 0.83 [CI0.69 to 0.90] for females ]4 yr old), and were similar at both areas. Weaning success (pups surviving to ]120 d), in contrast, was almost 50% lower at Amchitka than at Kodiak and for females ]4 yr of age was 0.52 (CI0.38 to 0.66) vs 0.94 (CI0.75 to 0.99), respectively. Sixty-two percent of the preweaning pup losses at Amchitka occurred within a month of parturition and 79% within two months. Postweaning survival was also low at Amchitka as only 18% of instrumented pups were known to be alive one year after mother-pup separation. Adult survival rates appeared similar at Amchitka and Kodiak. Factors affecting survival early in life thus are a primary demographic mechanism of population regulation in sea otters. By maintaining uniformly high reproductive rates over time and limiting investment in any particular reproductive event, sea otters can take advantage of unpredictable environmental changes favorable to pup survival. This strategy is consistent with predictions of ‘‘bet-hedging’’ life history models.},

  Abstract                 = {The meaningful incorporation of independent scientific advice into effective public policy is a hurdle for any conservation legislation. Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA; 2002) was designed to separate the science-based determination of a species’ risk status from the decision to award it legal protection. However, thereafter, the input of independent science into policy has not been clearly identifiable. Audits of SARA have identified clear deficiencies in the protection and recovery of listed species; for example, of the 176 species legally protected in 2003, only one has a legal implementation plan for its recovery. We argue that clearly distinguishing science from policy at all relevant stages would improve the scientific integrity, transparency, accountability, and public acceptance of the legal listing and recovery implementation processes in SARA. Such delineation would also clarify exactly what trade-offs are being made between at-risk species recovery and competing policy objectives},

Fish life history and population genetic variation were shaped by climate change, repeated formation and subsidence of ice sheets, sea-level change, volcanism and tectonics, isostatic rebound, and now human activities. It is widely recognized in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that parallel evolution and phenotypic plasticity have obscured range-wide patterns of life-history segregation with evolutionary lineage, yet the idea of the lineages themselves persists. We employed a large, internationally standardized, microsatellite data set to explore population structure at coast-wide scale and test for two divergent lineages, whether or not related to life history. We found at least 27 distinct lineages. However, relationships among groups were poorly resolved — essentially a star phylogeny. We found pervasive isolation by distance among groups, complicating cluster analysis. Only in the interior Columbia River (east of the Cascade Mountains) is there a deep genetic bifurcation that supports both the two-lineage hypothesis and the life-history segregation hypothesis. This broad-scale perspective helps reconcile different views of Chinook salmon phylogeography and life-history distribution.},

Species modelled were King George whiting (Sillaginodes punctata), greenback flounder (Rhombosolea tapirina), Australian salmon (Arripis trutta and A. truttaceus), and snapper (Pagrus auratus). Locations of commercial catches were reported through a grid system of fishing blocks. Spatial analyses in a Geographic Information System (GIS) were applied to describe each fishing block by its habitat area. A multivariate approach was adopted to group each fishing block by its dominant habitats. Standardized catch per unit effort values were overlaid on these groups to identify those that returned high or low catches for each species. A simple set of rules was then devised to predict the habitat suitability for each habitat combination in a fishing block. The spatial distribution of these habitats was presented in a GIS. These habitat suitability models were consistent with existing anecdotal information and expert opinion. While the models require testing, we have shown that in the absence of adequate fishery-independent data, commercial catch and effort data can be used to produce habitat suitability models at a bay-wide scale.},

  abstract  = {Assessing the vulnerability to storm surges requires amongst other things to identify the degree of coastal exposure to active waves. This paper proposes an integrated analytical approach that involves: 1) the degree of coastal exposure to different wave directions of incidence, 2) the extent of human structures at risk, and 3) the maximum wave height determination for each identified direction based on local wave climate analysis. It contributes to the development of a method for assessing vulnerability of existing built coastal assets to storm surge damages. Results provide a diagnostic of constructions? vulnerability, which is essential for adaptation and mitigation planning. This approach was applied to beaches of Santa Catarina Island on the Brazilian southern coast. The northeast wave direction endangers most of the area due to the existing occupation pattern close to the sea toward that quadrant. Extreme events are more frequently associated with south and southeast wave directions. Integrating all variables, northeast wave direction was confirmed as the most dangerous in the area, followed by southern, eastern and southeastern directions, respectively. These results differ from usual estimations that tend to consider the most frequent wave directions and higher intensities, without considering the potentially affected developed surfaces.},

Consequently, we model a zombie attack, using biological assumptions based on popular zombie movies. We introduce a basic model for zombie infection, determine equilibria and their stability, and illustrate the outcome with numerical solutions. We then refine the model to introduce a latent period of zombification, whereby humans are infected, but not infectious, before becoming undead. We then modify the model to include the effects of possible quarantine or a cure. Finally, we examine the impact of regular, impulsive reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which eradication can occur. We show that only quick, aggressive attacks can stave off the doomsday scenario: the collapse of society as zombies overtake us all.},

However, despite the apparent utility in addressing these problems, EAM has also been criticized as being nonspecific, immature, invalid as a basis for decision making, and not fully supported by science. While it is commonly perceived that a paradigm shift in governance and science institutions awaits implementation to address these criticisms, in fact, ecosystem considerations are being incorporated more frequently, employing existing authorities as the basis for mitigation of sectoral impacts and for resource allocation. Management ‘best practices’ for EAM are emerging based on these experiences. Ten common criticisms of EAM, which I believe to be myths propagated primarily to maintain the status quo among sectoral interests, are discussed. Accelerated evolution of EAM will occur as science better articulates feedbacks, cumulative ecological effects and economic consequences framing policy choices, and more formal ‘‘rules of engagement’’ among sectors (e.g., fishing, coastal development, water quality, and energy) are negotiated. These operating procedures would be established under informal arrangements, in national law, and by international agreement. The management paradigm for marine resources is shifting and EAM will eventually be considered redundant with established practice.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called"virtual population analysis" [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis. We suggest that age-specific abundance trends estimated from research surveys and VPA should be compared for all stocks where such data exist, and that high priority should be given to the measurement of discarding levels and the extent to which catch misreporting is related to changes in fishing mortality.},

Accordingly, the selection properties of the gear used for the taking of halibut has been a matter of long-standing study by the Commission.
This report defines some of the selection characteristics of trawl net gear of various codend mesh sizes. The selection properties of the setline gear commonly used in the North American setline halibut fishery are also described. The sustainable yields of halibut that could be produced by fisheries employing these gears are examined.},

Logbook reporting rate filter (RRF) levels are evaluated through analytical and model-based comparisons to species-specific logbook records available since 1994 and shipboard observer data. At the high reporting rates, the >=80% filter avoids large numbers of false zeros and provides the best fit to observer data for blue shark. At the low reporting rates, the <=40% filter best matches the observer data for makos, but this filter level includes large numbers of false zeros and sharks of other species. The <=20% filter produces a dataset that is better targeted to mako catches but considerably under-estimates CPUE relative to observer records. For these reasons, other means of estimating mako catch rates are suggested for further research.},

Integrating complex and often uncertain information into spatial PVA models requires that comprehensive sensitivity analyses be applied to explore the influence of spatial and nonspatial parameters on model predictions. We reviewed 87 analyses of spatial demographic PVA models of plants and animals to identify common approaches to sensitivity analysis in recent publications. In contrast to best practices recommended in the broader modeling community, sensitivity analyses of spatial PVAs were typically ad hoc, inconsistent, and
difficult to compare. Most studies applied local approaches to sensitivity analyses, but few varied multiple parameters simultaneously. A lack of standards for sensitivity analysis and reporting in spatial PVAs has the potential to compromise the ability to learn collectively from PVA results, accurately interpret results in cases where model relationships include nonlinearities and interactions, prioritize monitoring and management actions, and ensure conservation-planning decisions are robust to uncertainties in spatial and nonspatial parameters. Our review underscores the need to develop tools for global sensitivity analysis and apply these to spatial PVA.},

  abstract  = {Efforts to locate and map deep-water coral and sponge habitats are essential for the effective management and conservation of these vulnerable marine ecosystems. Here we test the applicability of a simple multibeam sonar classification method developed for fjord environments to map the distribution of shelf-depth substrates and gorgonian coral- and sponge-dominated biotopes. The studied area is a shelf-depth feature Learmonth Bank, northern British Columbia, Canada and the method was applied aiming to map primarily non-reef forming coral and sponge biotopes. Aside from producing high-resolution maps (5 m2 raster grid), biotope-substrate associations were also investigated. A multibeam sonar survey yielded bathymetry, acoustic backscatter strength and slope. From benthic video transects recorded by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) six primary substrate types and twelve biotope categories were identified, defined by the primary sediment and dominant biological structure, respectively. Substrate and biotope maps were produced using a supervised classification mostly based on the inter-quartile range of the acoustic variables for each substrate type and biotope. Twenty-five percent of the video observations were randomly reserved for testing the classification accuracy. The dominant biotope-defining corals were red tree coral Primnoa pacifica and small styasterids, of which Stylaster parageus was common. Demosponges and hexactinellid sponges were frequently observed but no sponge reefs were observed. The substrate classification readily distinguished fine sediment, Sand and Bedrock from the other substrate types, but had greater difficulty distinguishing Bedrock from Boulders and Cobble. The biotope classification accurately identified Gardens (dense aggregations of sponges and corals) and Primnoa-dominated biotopes (67% accuracy), but most other biotopes had lower accuracies. There was a significant correspondence between Learmonth's biotopes and substrate types, with many biotopes strongly associated with only a single substrate type. This strong correspondence allowed substrate types to function as a surrogate for helping to map biotope distributions. Our results add new information on the distribution of corals and sponges at Learmonth Bank, which can be used to guide management at this location.},

  abstract    = {Sea otters were extirpated from British Columbia by 1929. In an effort to re-establish the species in Canada, 89 sea otters from Alaska were re-introduced to Checleset Bay, Vancouver Island between 1969 and 1972. The most recent population surveys indicate that, based on direct counts the B.C. sea otter population includes a minimum of 3,180 sea otters (surveys 2001 to 2004) (Nichol et al. 2005). The population occurs along the west coast of Vancouver Island and on a small section of the central B.C. coast although most of the population (~85%) occurs along the west coast of Vancouver Island. Population growth has been positive, at 19.1% per year on Vancouver Island between 1977 and 1995 but slowed to 8.0% per year (1995 to 2004) for an overall average annual rate of 15.6% per year between 1977 and 2004. Growth may have slowed along Vancouver Island as parts of the range have reach equilibrium densities. On the central B.C. coast growth has average 12.4% per year (1990 to 2004). Based on historical information from the maritime fur trade and on modeling of available habitat the population in B.C. likely occupies at most 25 to 33% of its historic range. Coast-wide sea otter habitat carrying capacity estimates of 14,844 (9,798-20,769, 95% CI) for optimal habitat and 52,199 (48,672-59,018, 95% CI) based on otters per kilometer of shoreline suggest that at its current size the Canadian sea otter population is far below carrying capacity.
Population growth and range expansion are inter-related in this species. Sea otters are non-migratory and occupy small overlapping home ranges. Range expansion occurs as areas of occupation near carrying capacity. Male sea otters then move from the periphery of the occupied range into adjacent habitat. Females subsequently occupy the new habitat once the males have moved on. Therefore given this inter-relationship it follows that increasing the geographic range of the species is expected to result in both a larger population and one in which the risk from human activities is reduced. An interim recovery target is therefore to continue the range expansion of the species in British Columbia. 
Estimates of allowable harm that would not jeopardize recovery were presented based on the effect of mortality on the time to achieve recovery in two geographic areas that encompass the current range on west coast Vancouver Island and on the central B.C. coast. The resulting estimates, 40 to 90 animals per year on Vancouver Island and 20 to 25 animals per year on the central B.C. coast were predicted to delay recovery by < 10% to a target level in each area of 80 to 95% of the habitat-based carrying capacity estimate. The target levels > 80% of carrying capacity were chosen to reflect the inter-relationship between population growth and range expansion. The assumptions made to calculate these estimates and the uncertainties of some of the model parameters, in particular the habitat-based carrying capacity estimates for the central coast section are discussed. Should a directed take be considered for the B.C. population, harvest should be deferred on the central B.C. coast because of the uncertainties and assumption and because that portion of the population is very small. For west coast Vancouver Island, the lower estimate would be precautionary should a directed take be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea otters were re-introduced to British Columbia from Alaska between 1969 and 1972. The first population count was made in 1977. Since 1988, field surveys have been undertaken using small boat or helicopter, to determine sea otter population abundance and trends in British Columbia. Our goal in this study was to assess the survey procedure in use and to obtain current population counts. The results of this study suggest the present method of estimating sea otter abundance in British Columbia can provide a relatively precise (CV = 7-12%) index of abundance in Good to Excellent survey conditions. Surveys from helicopter and boat, made under similar sea conditions, provide comparable counts. A total of 3,180 sea otters were counted in a complete survey in 2001, 2,673 along Vancouver Island and 507 on the central mainland coast. Watson et al. (1997) estimated population growth to have been 18.6% year-1 on Vancouver Island between 1977 and 1995. The population growth rate on Vancouver Island has declined to 15.6% year-1, 1977 – 2004, and this appears to have taken place since 1995. Sea otters are a density dependent species and populations are limited largely by food. Rapid initial growth followed by a decline in growth rate as portions of the population range reach equilibrium with resources seems to be typical of re-introduced sea otter populations. On the central mainland coast, the sea otter population range is small in relation to the availability of habitat and resources, and thus rapid growth might be expected. Survey results indicate growth has been positive on the central mainland coast from 1990 to 2004, but the fit of the simple log-linear regression is relatively poor and the resulting growth rate estimate of 12.4% year-1, seems low. Further survey effort will be needed to better ascertain the population growth rate on the central mainland coast.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Random forests (RF) have been increasingly used in applications such as genome-wide association and microarray studies where predictor correlation is frequently observed. Recent works on permutation-based variable importance measures (VIMs) used in RF have come to apparently contradictory conclusions. We present an extended simulation study to synthesize results.
RESULTS:In the case when both predictor correlation was present and predictors were associated with the outcome (HA), the unconditional RF VIM attributed a higher share of importance to correlated predictors, while under the null hypothesis that no predictors are associated with the outcome (H0) the unconditional RF VIM was unbiased. Conditional VIMs showed a decrease in VIM values for correlated predictors versus the unconditional VIMs under HA and was unbiased under H0. Scaled VIMs were clearly biased under HA and H0.
CONCLUSIONS:Unconditional unscaled VIMs are a computationally tractable choice for large datasets and are unbiased under the null hypothesis. Whether the observed increased VIMs for correlated predictors may be considered a "bias" - because they do not directly reflect the coefficients in the generating model - or if it is a beneficial attribute of these VIMs is dependent on the application. For example, in genetic association studies, where correlation between markers may help to localize the functionally relevant variant, the increased importance of correlated predictors may be an advantage. On the other hand, we show examples where this increased importance may result in spurious signals.},

  abstract  = {Understanding patterns of species occurrence and abundance is a central theme of ecology, natural resource management, and conservation. Although occurrence modelshave been widely used for describing species distribution, particularly for rare species, abundance models are less common, despite greater information for conservation and management. Because presence-absence data are easier and less expensive to collect, predictions of abundance from patterns of occurrence could prove useful.We examined the relationship between occurrence and abundance for two species with very different life histories: bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum and moose Alces alces. We predicted that if occurrence and abundance were functionally related we should observe: 1) correlation between predicted probability of occurrence and observed abundance; 2) similar environmental covariates and estimated coefficients for occurrence models developed separately for low-density, high-density, and global data sites; and 3) parallel coefficients for the occurrence and abundance components of zero-inflated count models. Probability of occurrence was not correlated with abundance-when-present for bracken fern, while evidence for a relationship for moose was apparent at densities of animals below 7 individuals per cutblock. Coefficients for models at different levels of density did not vary significantly. However, once occurrence was accounted for, measured environmental data appeared less important in describing abundance. For bracken, covariates of zero-inflated count models differed in their expression of occurrence and abundance. Differences were less extreme for moose; however, results from the two-process models suggest that distribution and abundance may be a function of different processes. Environmental factors influencing abundance may differ from those limiting distribution. Life history, scale, site history, and sociocompetitive processes further help shape patterns of abundance. Two-stage modeling provides a powerful tool for describing animal and plant distribution where the processes of occurrence and abundance are influenced by different factors.},

  Abstract                 = {The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb - most commonly the rule of 10 - associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

  Abstract                 = {New Zealand seamounts support major fisheries for several deepwater fish species, including orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) and smooth oreo (Pseudocyttus maculatus). Although a high proportion of features in the depth range 500- 1000 m have been fished, very little is known about the ecological impacts of bottom trawling on seamounts. The potential impact is likely to be influenced by the spatial extent and frequency of fishing. A new index is presented to assess the relative intensity of trawling on New Zealand seamounts. The fishing effects index (FEI) incorporates information on the density of fishing on the seamount as a proportion of the seabed area and also on tow direction. Detailed fisheries data from more than 250 000 tows were examined to calculate FEI for New Zealand seamounts. The most intensively fished seamounts were on the south Chatham Rise, an area characterised by a large number of relatively small features which were fished serially for orange roughy in the 1980s and 1990s. Other seamounts with high FEI were on the north Chatham Rise, Challenger Plateau, and off the east coast of the North Island. A range of sensitivity analyses indicated that the general rankings of seamounts were relatively robust to the choice of arbitrary thresholds used to assign tows to seamounts.},

2. Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 
3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 
4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 
5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous expert elicitation methods have been suggested for generalised linear models (GLMs). This paper compares three relatively new approaches to eliciting expert knowledge in a form suitable for Bayesian logistic regression. These methods were trialled on two experts in order to model the habitat suitability of the threatened Australian brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata). The first elicitation approach is a geographically assisted indirect predictive method with a geographic information system (GIS) interface. The second approach is a predictive indirect method which uses an interactive graphical tool. The third method uses a questionnaire to elicit expert knowledge directly about the impact of a habitat variable on the response. Two variables (slope and aspect) are used to examine prior and posterior distributions of the three methods. The results indicate that there are some similarities and dissimilarities between the expert informed priors of the two experts formulated from the different approaches. The choice of elicitation method depends on the statistical knowledge of the expert, their mapping skills, time constraints, accessibility to experts and funding available. This trial reveals that expert knowledge can be important when modelling rare event data, such as threatened species, because experts can provide additional information that may not be represented in the dataset. However care must be taken with the way in which this information is elicited and formulated.},

  Abstract                 = {Interspecific hybridization is a route for transgenes from genetically modified (GM) animals to invade wild populations, yet the ecological effects and potential risks that may emerge from such hybridization are unknown. Through experimental crosses, we demonstrate transmission of a growth hormone transgene via hybridization between a candidate for commercial aquaculture production, GM Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and closely related wild brown trout (Salmo trutta). Transgenic hybrids were viable and grew more rapidly than transgenic salmon and other non-transgenic crosses in hatchery-like conditions. In stream mesocosms designed to more closely emulate natural conditions, transgenic hybrids appeared to express competitive dominance and suppressed the growth of transgenic and non-transgenic (wild-type) salmon by 82 and 54 per cent, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of environmental impacts of hybridization between a GM animal and a closely related species. These results provide empirical evidence of the first steps towards introgression of foreign transgenes into the genomes of new species and contribute to the growing evidence that transgenic animals have complex and context-specific interactions with wild populations. We suggest that interspecific hybridization be explicitly considered when assessing the environmental consequences should transgenic animals escape to nature.},

  abstract  = {Modern wildlife management relies on studies investigating the distribution patterns and habitat selection of wildlife at appropriately large scales for decision-making. One important aspect to consider in the assessment of habitat suitability and the underlying mechanism of animal distribution is the spatial distribution of their food resources. In marine areas, where many mammal and bird species occur over large spatial scales, the analysis of habitat use and distribution patterns requires information on the distribution of food resources at appropriately large scales (Huettmann and Diamond 2006). An important food resource for several species of marine birds and mammals are invertebrate organisms that live on the bottom of the sea and are collectively described as the benthos, a community that is especially productive and diverse at high latitudes (Carey 1991; Piepenburg 2005; Starmans et al. 1999). The distribution and productivity of benthic foragers such as ice seals, walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), sea ducks (Somateria spp., Melanitta spp.), and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) is influenced by the distribution of accessible benthic prey resources (Kaiser et al. 2006; Lovvorn et al. 2003; Moore et al. 2003). Benthic invertebrates thus form a key component in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems, and the distribution of marine benthic invertebrates is of major interest to wildlife managers (Solan et al. 2004). Most of the species mentioned above are of management concern, and either are (Spectacled Eider, Somateria fischeri; Steller's Eider, Polysticta stelleri) or have been proposed (walrus, ice seals) to be listed as ‘threatened’. Therefore, the identification and delineation of critical habitat providing sufficient food resources for these species will become extremely important in the near future.},

  abstract  = {Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use.},

  Abstract                 = {The design of marine reserves is complex and fraught with uncertainty. However, protection of critical habitat is of paramount importance for reserve design. We present a case study as an example of a reserve design based on fine-scale habitats, the affinities of exploited species to these habitats, adult mobility, and the physical forcing affecting the dynamics of the habitats. These factors and their interaction are integrated in an algorithm that determines the optimal size and location of a marine reserve for a set of 20 exploited species within five different habitats inside a large kelp forest in southern California. The result is a reserve that encompasses ~42% of the kelp forest. Our approach differs fundamentally from many other marine reserve siting methods in which goals of area, diversity, or biomass are targeted a priori. Rather, our method was developed to determine how large a reserve must be within a specific area to protect a self-sustaining assemblage of exploited species. The algorithm is applicable across different ecosystems, spatial scales, and for any number of species. The result is a reserve in which habitat value is optimized for a predetermined set of exploited species against the area left open to exploitation. The importance of fine-scale habitat definitions for the exploited species off La Jolla is exemplified by the spatial pattern of habitats and the stability of these habitats within the kelp forest, both of which appear to be determined by ocean microclimate.},

  Abstract                 = {An increasing awareness of the effects that the spatial scale of source maps may have on landscape analyses has lately prompted much research on this topic. Nevertheless, previous studies have just focused on describing the variations of different landscape metrics with scale, while the scale impact on the actual decision-making and landscape planning derived from connectivity analyses has not yet been tackled.We examined the influence of varying minimum mapping unit (MMU) and spatial extent on the prioritization of patches by their importance for the conservation of overall landscape connectivity, according to 10 different metrics as management support tools.We analyzed the forest patches distribution in three study zones within Spain with diverse spatial configuration from CORINE land cover data. Our results showed that the probability of connectivity, the area-weighted flux and the integral index of connectivity are the most robust metrics in terms of patches prioritization, while the results provided by the number of components, graph diameter and class coincidence probability are strongly scale-dependent. We found that scale sensitivity of the overall landscape metric value is not related to scale sensitivity in terms of patches prioritization. We provide guidelines for an appropriate selection of connectivity metrics and scale of analysis for landscape conservation planning and related applications.},

  abstract  = {The loss of connectivity of natural areas is a major threat for wildlife dispersal and survival and for the conservation of biodiversity in general. Thus, there is an increasing interest in considering connectivity in landscape planning and habitat conservation. In this context, graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and effective way of both representing the landscape pattern as a network and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity. Many indices have been used for connectivity analyses so far but comparatively very little efforts have been made to understand their behaviour and sensitivity to spatial changes, which seriously undermines their adequate interpretation and usefulness. We systematically compare a set of ten graph-based connectivity indices, evaluating their reaction to different types of change that can occur in the landscape (habitat patches loss, corridors loss, etc.) and their effectiveness for identifying which landscape elements are more critical for habitat conservation. Many of the available indices were found to present serious limitations that make them inadequate as a basis for conservation planning. We present a new index (IIC) that achieves all the properties of an ideal index according to our analysis. We suggest that the connectivity problem should be considered within the wider concept of habitat availability, which considers a habitat patch itself as a space where connectivity exists, integrating habitat amount and connectivity between habitat patches in a single measure.},

The usefulness of the package is illustrated with two small simulation studies on boundary length estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the genetic and morphological status of an endemic subspecies of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae) on Anacapa Island of California through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis, morphometric discriminant function analysis, and population viability analysis. We sought to assist the development of a management plan that may include captive breeding, reintroduction, or translocation of mice following eradication of introduced rats. The genetic and morphological data were used to investigate whether the subspecies or populations on each of the three islets of Anacapa represent evolutionarily significant units for conservation. The status of the East Anacapa population was of particular concern because deer mice have recently been caught there following more than 15 years of no records of deer mice. Sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase c subunit II gene (COII) indicated that the Anacapa subspecies had unique haplotypes not found on neighboring islands or the mainland and thus represents a distinct unit for conservation. Further, one of these haplotypes was shared among the islets, including most of the East Anacapa mice, suggesting that the East Anacapa population had either recovered from a severe bottleneck or had been recolonized by P. m. anacapae, but that it was not derived from other subspecies. Discriminant function analysis of morphological data also supported classification of the East Anacapa mice as P. m. anacapae. The mitochondrial mtDNA sequence data yielded estimates of two to seven migrants per generation among the Anacapa islets, suggesting a functioning metapopulation. Incorporating these data and information available on the life history and demographics of deer mice, we used a novel type of population viability analysis to develop a captive breeding and reintroduction plan for Anacapa deer mice should they be eradicated along with the rats. A sine wave was incorporated into the population viability analysis to simulate population size cyclicity. Our study provides baseline information needed for developing a comprehensive conservation and management plan for a threatened island endemic.},

This situation creates controversial trade-offs between recovery actions and economic revenue. We conducted a Bayesian decision analysis to evaluate options for recovery of Cultus Lake sockeye salmon. We used a stochastic population model that included 2 sources of uncertainty that are often omitted from such analyses: structural uncertainty in the magnitude of a potential Allee effect and implementation uncertainty (the deviation between targets and actual outcomes of management actions). Numerous state-dependent, time-independent management actions meet recovery objectives. These actions prescribe limitations on commercial harvest rates as a function of abundance of Cultus Lake sockeye salmon. We also quantified how much reduction in economic value of commercial harvests of the more abundant sockeye salmon populations would be expected for a given increase in the probability of recovery of the Cultus population. Such results illustrate how Bayesian decision analysis can rank options for dealing with conservation risks and can help inform trade-off discussions among decision makers and among groups that have competing objectives.},

We found that decreasing time trends in productivity have occurred across a large geographic area ranging from Washington, B.C., southeast Alaska, and up through the Yakutat peninsula, Alaska, but not in central and western Alaska. Furthermore, a pattern of predominantly shared trends across southern stocks and opposite trends between them and stocks from western Alaska was present in the past (1950–1985), but correlations have intensified since then. The spatial extent of declining productivity of sockeye salmon has important implications for management as well as research into potential causes of the declines. Further research should focus on mechanisms that operate at large, multiregional spatial scales, and (or) in marine areas where numerous correlated sockeye stocks overlap.},

(ii) Hierarchical models applied to multi-stock data sets can improve estimates of probability distributions for model parameters compared with those derived through single-stock analyses. (iii) Operating models of complete fishery systems provide comprehensive platforms for testing management procedures.

Typically, large variability and measurement errors in data create challenges for estimating risks and identifying appropriate management strategies. The formal quantitative method of decision analysis can help deal with these challenges because it takes uncertainties into account explicitly and quantitatively. In recent years, research in several areas of natural resource management has demonstrated that decision analysis can identify policies that are appropriate in the presence of uncertainties. More importantly, the resulting optimal decision is often different from the one that would have been chosen had the uncertainties not been taken into account quantitatively. However, challenges still exist to effective implementation of decision analysis.},

However, because of large natural variability and measurement error in fisheries data, such changes are usually difficult to detect until long after they occur. Previous research using numerous Monte Carlo simulation trials showed that a Kalman filter performed better than standard estimation techniques in detecting such trends in a timely manner. Therefore, we used historical data along with a Kalman filter that included a time-varying Ricker a parameter to reconstruct changes in productivity (recruits per spawner at a given spawner abundance) of eight Bristol Bay, Alaska, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks over the past 40 years. Productivity generally increased for most stocks but varied widely for others and dramatically decreased in another. Such large changes in productivity are important for management. They greatly affected optimal spawner abundances and optimal exploitation rates, suggesting that in the future, scientists should consider using models with time-varying productivity parameters.},

Decision analysis provided a useful approach for including multiple hypotheses about population responses to environmental and anthropogenic factors, systematically assessing the importance of alternative hypotheses, and identifying risk-averse recovery strategies that meet survival and recovery goals over a wide range of uncertainties. We found that the most influential uncertainties were related to hypothesized causes of estuary and ocean mortality. Current monitoring provides limited information on survival in this life stage; carefully designed management experiments are more likely to generate useful information. Given that these uncertainties exist, drawdown was the most risk-averse action, meeting long-term survival and recovery goals over a wider range of assumptions than the other actions.},

  Abstract                 = {An important issue in ecohydrological research is distribution modelling, aiming at the prediction of species or vegetation type occurrence on the basis of empirical relations with hydrological or hydrogeochemical habitat conditions. In this study, two statistical techniques are evaluated: (i) the widely used multiple logistic regression technique in the generalized linear modelling framework, and (ii) a recently developed machine learning technique called ‘random forests’. The latter is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual results. The two different techniques are used to develop distribution models to predict the vegetation type occurrence of 11 groundwater-dependent vegetation types in Belgian lowland valley ecosystems based on spatially distributed measurements of environmental conditions. The spatially distributed data set under investigation consists of 1705 grid cells covering an area of 47.32 ha. After model construction and calibration, both models are applied to independent test data sets using two-fold cross-validation and resulting probabilities of occurrence are used to predict vegetation type distributions within the study area. Predicted vegetation types are compared with observations, and the McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model at the 0.001 significance level. Comparison of the modelling results for each individual vegetation type separately by means of the F-measure, which combines precision and recall, also reveals better predictions by the random forest model. Inspection of the probabilities of occurrence of the different vegetation types for each grid cell demonstrates that correct predictions in central areas of homogeneous vegetation sites are based on high probabilities, whereas the confidence decreases towards the margins of these areas. Threshold-independent evaluation of the model accuracy by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirms good performances of both models, but with higher values for the random forest model. Therefore, the incorporation of the random forest technique in distribution models has the ability to lead to better model performances.},

  Abstract                 = {A synthesis of the literature on benthic responses to marine pollution suggests that macroinfaunal and meiofaunal communities exhibit repeatable patterns of response to sedimentary contamination generally detectable at high taxonomic levels (even phylum). These responses appear to be jointly driven by intrinsic physiological and ecological characteristics of higher taxa, such that crustaceans (especially amphipods and harpacticoids) and echinoderms are sensitive to toxics whereas polychaetes, oligochaetes, and nematodes (especially non-selective deposit feeders) are enhanced by organic enrichment. Application of this model to the GOOMEX results implies involvement of both toxicity and organic enrichment. Results of toxicity tests and comparisons of observed contaminant concentrations to known effects levels imply that metals drive the toxicity response. We conclude that (1) long-lasting effects of drilling activity exist in the sedimentary environment around gas production platforms, (2) dual effects of toxicity and organic enrichment probably drive readily detectable responses in benthic meiofauna and macroinfauna to 100–200 m, and (3) the failure to detect evidence of exposure or sublethal impacts on fishes and most larger invertebrates is a joint consequence of their mobility over the relevant scales of environmental change and their negligible exposure to hydrocarbons and other contaminants.},

However, in the Alaskan coastal ecosystem, unexpected persistence of toxic subsurface oil and chronic exposures, even at sublethal levels, have continued to affect wildlife.

Mercenaria mercenaria, recruitment, 2) seagrass biomass. 3) the density of benthic macroinvertebrates. and 4) the density of bay scallops. ArglJPecten ·irradiaml. The removal of adult hard clams with the contingent sediment disturbance had ambiguous effects on the recruitment of hard clams: in the sand flat recruitment tended to be lower (but not significantly) in intense-clam-kicking matrices than in controls, whereas in seagrass recruitment of hard clams did not not show a clear response to treatment. In the raking and light-clam-kicking matrices. seagrass biomass fell immediately by !l!25% below controls but full recovery occurred within a year. In the intense-clam-kicking matrices, seagrass biomass fell by !l!65% below levels expected from controls; recovery did not begin until more than 2 years passed, and seagrass biomass was still !l!35% lower than predicted from controls 4 years later. Clam harvest did not affect either the density or species composition of small benthic macroinvertebrates from sediment cores. probably because of their rapid capacity for recolonization and generally short life spans. In all treatments. densities of benthic macroinvertebrates (mostly polychaetes) were substantially higher in the seagrass than in the sand flat during October samplings but equal during March samplings. Bay scallop density declined with declining seagrass biomass across harvest treatments, but the intense-clamkicking matrices contained even fewer bay scallops than their seagrass biomass would predict, perhaps because of enhanced patchiness of the remaining seagrass.
The relative inertia of the change in seagrass biomass following extensive destruction in the intensely kicked matrices suggests that seagrass replanting may be an extremely important means of returning disturbed, unvegetated areas to seagrass systems. Emergence during summer of a between-habitat gradient in infaunal densities (higher in seagrass than in sand) supports the hypothesis that seagrass provides a partial prey refuge for infaunal invertebrates. The failure of the benthic macroinvertebrate density to respond to clam harvest treatments in both sand flats and seagrass beds implies that the polychaetes which dominate recover rapidly from disturbance and are probably not adversely affected by clam harvest. The negative and long-lasting impact of intense hard clam harvest on seagrass biomass with its effects on other fisheries, including bay scallops. implies that hard clam fisheries should be managed to minimize the intensity of harvest within seagrass beds.},

  Abstract                 = {Native salmonid fishes often face simultaneous threats from habitat fragmentation and invasion by nonnative trout species. Unfortunately, management actions to address one may create or exacerbate the other. A consistent decision process would include a systematic analysis of when and where intentional use or removal of barriers is the most appropriate action. We developed a Bayesian belief network as a tool for such analyses. We focused on native westslope cutthroat trout (<I>Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi</I>) and nonnative brook trout (<I>Salvelinus fontinalis</I>) and considered the environmental factors influencing both species, their potential interactions, and the effects of isolation on the persistence of local cutthroat trout populations. The trade-offs between isolation and invasion were strongly influenced by size and habitat quality of the stream network to be isolated and existing demographic linkages within and among populations. An application of the model in several sites in western Montana (USA) showed the process could help clarify management objectives and options and prioritize conservation actions among streams. The approach can also facilitate communication among parties concerned with native salmonids, nonnative fish invasions, barriers and intentional isolation, and management of the associated habitats and populations.},

Conflict regarding conservation and preservation of endangered species is among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Endangered species management on private lands magnifies the problems encountered by natural resource policy-makers and managers. Given that conservation of endangered species increasingly depends on securing cooperation of private property owners in local communities, understanding how to secure that cooperation is important. We used an ethnographic approach to critically review the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) processes used in attempts to develop regional HCPs to benefit the Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis) and the Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium; hereafter, Key deer). In both cases, the process was framed as a search for the optimum solution through collaboration and consensus building, and in neither case was the solution achieved. The paradoxical nature of liberal democracy precluded the possibility of a single, ideal solution. Failing to find the optimal solution led to disillusionment and pessimism with the process among HCP participants. We suggest that within democratic political contexts, approaches to conservation planning that center around bounded conflict, which is rooted in acknowledgment of the paradox inherent to the ideals of liberty and equality, are more likely to produce satisfactory results than are consensus-based approaches.},

During this period, the Zoological Station in Dm Helder (The Netherlands) has collected and registered by-catch species caught by commercial fishermen. The annual numbers of registered specimens were used to estimate the species-specific catch efficiencies of otter and beam trawlers between 1945 and 1983. This analysis was restricted to fishes (sharks, rays, skates) and 10 invertebrate species (whelks, urchins, squids, crabs) all of which have a demersal life style and were regularly delivered throughout the study period. For most species. the observed variations in annual numbers of fish and invertebrates delivered to the Zoological Station appeared to be related to the changes in type of gear and fishing effort. Results from the model suggest hat otter trawlers caught relatively more fish than invertebrates. whilst beam trawlers caught proportionally more invertebrate species (i,e. velvet swimming crab, slender spindle shell) that were rarely delivered during periods of greatest otter trawling effort. On average, the catch efficiency of the beam trawl;I fleer appeared to be IO times higher than that of the otter trawl fleet. Furthermore, the trends shown by the model in species delivered suggested that bottom fisheries had a considerable impact on several demersal fish and benthic invertebrates.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of the landscape matrix on patterns of animal movement and population dynamics has been widely recognized by ecologists. However, few tools are available to model the matrix's influence on the length, relative quality, and redundancy of dispersal routes connecting habitat patches. Many GIS software packages can use land use/land cover maps to identify the route of least resistance between two points -- the least-cost path. The limitation of this type of analysis is that only a single path is identified, even though alternative paths with comparable costs might exist. In this paper, we implemented two graph theory methods that extend the least-cost path approach: the Conditional Minimum Transit Cost (CMTC) tool and the Multiple Shortest Paths (MSPs) tool. Both methods enable the visualization of multiple dispersal routes that, together, are assumed to form a corridor. We show that corridors containing alternative dispersal routes emerge when favorable habitat is randomly distributed in space. As clusters of favorable habitat start forming, corridors become less redundant and dispersal bottlenecks become visible. Our approach is illustrated using data from a real landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We explored the effect of small, localized disturbance on dispersal routes linking conservation units. Simulated habitat destruction caused the appearance of alternative dispersal routes, or caused existing corridors to become narrower. These changes were observed even in the absence of significant differences in the length or cost of least-cost paths. Last, we discuss applications to animal movement studies and conservation initiatives.},

  Abstract                 = {A multiple Before-After-Control-Impact experiment was conducted to estimate the large scale effects of a single coverage by prawn trawlers on an offshore inter-reef area in the northern Great Barrier Reef that was closed to fishing. Prospective power and cost-benefit analyses facilitated the design and optimization of the experiment, the effect size of which was guided by prior publications at the time that had indicated impacts of 10-100×. The optimal design, given the number of factors to be tested and the constraint of available ship time (100 days) and resources needed to process samples, was for 12 control and 12 impact plots each measuring ~2.8 km × 1.2 km. The final design specification was capable of detecting an average -80% effect size (5×). The experiment was divided over two seasons, wet and dry. During the experimental trawl impact phase, a total of 32 t of benthic biota was removed from six shallow plots (15-25 m depth) and 6 t from six deep plots (30-50 m depth). Sampling before and 6 months after impact was conducted by an epibenthic dredge, a prawn trawl and a fish trawl. Analysis of means before and after impact, relative to controls, showed very few significant differences. This indicated that the impact of a single prawn trawl was less than the design specification. The lower than expected impact, compared to previous studies, may have been partly because this study included all benthic groups, not just the most sensitive as earlier studies had focussed on. Comparison of catch rates from the prawn trawl and the dredge indicated the overall impact on total biomass was around -3% but ranged from close to 0% for some species to around -20% for sensitive sessile species. A review of effect sizes in 30 other recent trawl experiments indicated that this result was not exceptional; i.e. the reported effects of single trawls generally were not large, and prawn trawls appeared to have smaller effect sizes than fish trawls, beam trawls and scallop dredges--also, several studies reported recovery within ca. 6 months. Analysis of fishery effort data indicated that this result was appropriate for the majority of trawl fishing grounds, where effort is sparse and infrequent. Many published experiments had confounded designs and most had not used a priori power analyses or pre-specified effect sizes. Nevertheless, recurrent trawling can be expected to have cumulative impacts on benthos, as has been demonstrated by repeat-trawl depletion experiments. On the other hand, the spatial extent of fishing grounds trawled as intensively as these depletion experiments is quite limited.},

  abstract  = {1. Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables. 
2. To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along >30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach, Gradient Forest, an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses. 
3. The regional-scale environmental variables predicted an average of 13--35% (up to 50--85% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio-physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets. 
4. Synthesis and applications. Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has similar applicability in terrestrial realms.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimate the possible overall status of populations of attached seabed fauna after 20 years of trawling in Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), based on the key results of a five-year experimental study that provided an understanding of faunal resilience, in terms of removal rates per trawl. The removal rates of most seabed fauna were between 5 and 20% per trawl (range 0-40%). In attempting to estimate population status, it was also necessary to review patterns of trawl effort intensity and add a simple model for possible recovery dynamics of fauna. Large areas of the GBR are subject to trawling. In 1996, effort was recorded in 1300 statistical grids, each 6x6 minutes, an area equivalent to [~]153 000 km2. Effort was highly aggregated among the grids, with about 20% concentrated into <5% of trawled grounds (intensive); at the other extreme, about 20% of the effort was spread over about 60% of the trawled grounds (extensive). Trawling was also highly aggregated at fine scales within grids; consequently a smaller area is actually trawled than is indicated by summing up 6 min grids. The amount of fauna removed each year is related to the resilience of the fauna to removal, the intensity of trawling, and its degree of aggregation. In lightly trawled grids, the annual removal may have been only a low percentage, but in the most intensively trawled grids, more than 80% of the least resilient fauna may be removed each year. In high-effort grids, aggregated trawling removes smaller amounts of benthos than if effort were distributed randomly or uniformly. The average annual removal of fauna over all trawled grids differs for different fauna. A total of about 4% of high-resilience fauna may be removed,[~]8% of medium-resilience fauna, and [~]15% of low-resilience fauna. The overall vulnerability of fauna is a combination of resilience and recovery rates. Fauna with no capacity for recovery will eventually be completely removed from all trawled areas. All fauna with a capacity for recovery have the potential for sustaining a population level in balance with the amount removed by trawling, up to certain limits. The most vulnerable fauna may be completely removed from the 5-10% of grids that are trawled with >2000-3000 h of effort. More fauna will be removed from grids with higher effort. Though 50-70% of trawled grids have been trawled only lightly (<700-1000 h) each year, over the last 20 years there has been a cumulative effect. A generalized depletion across all trawled grids is likely, but fauna with low vulnerability may be depleted by only 3% overall; medium vulnerability fauna may be depleted by about 20%; and highly vulnerable populations may be depleted by about 55% overall. Because of differential vulnerability, the composition of the faunal community will be substantially altered in most grids, with a shift to less vulnerable species.},

  Abstract                 = {This primer outlines common approaches for setting recovery targets and quantifying critical habitat for species at risk. Critical habitat is protected under the Species at Risk Act, and defined as the habitat necessary and sufficient for species survival or recovery. Key questions that need to be addressed when identifying critical habitat relate to the amount, quality and configuration of habitat needed to achieve a specified population or habitat-based recovery target. The process of delineating population and habitat based recovery targets is, by its nature, complex and quantitative approaches are often required. This primer introduces commonly used quantitative approaches for setting recovery targets and for identifying critical habitat, including: habitat suitability (HS) models; incidence function models (IFM); demographic based estimates of: area per individual (API), and minimum area for population viability (MAPV); and habitat based spatially explicit population viability analyses (PVA). In this primer, each modelling approach is introduced, data requirements are described, and advantages and limitations are discussed. Included in this primer, readers will find specific references to software or freely available code to allow them to implement these quantitative approaches themselves.},

Factors associated with known extinctions and near extinctions include specific life-history characteristics (e.g. low fecundity, high age at maturity, low mobility), habitat degradation, high value and high susceptibility to harvesting, ecological specialization. Harvesting mortality, targeted or incidental, is implicated in some known extinctions or near extinctions, and may act synergistically with other threats. Criteria to make assessments of risk of extinction more consistent have been developed, but given the limited experience to date with extinctions in the marine environment there have been questions about applying these to some marine species. The wide range of life history characteristics in marine species suggests that a range of approaches to assessing extinction risk will be needed. Protocols for defining significant population units are also required since protection of populations is part of protecting endangered species. Keeping species and populations well away from endangered status should be the main goal of conservation programmes. Implementation of precautionary conservation frameworks for exploited species could be a sound approach to preventing "endangerment".},

The data consist of summer visual and acoustical detections of sperm whales, compiled between 1998 and 2005. Habitat maps were computed using topographical and hydrological eco-geographical variables. Four methods were compared: principal component analysis (PCA), ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The evaluation of the models was achieved by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the models and their respective area under the curve (AUC). Presence--absence methods (GLM, AUC=0.70, and MARS, AUC=0.79) presented better AUC than presence-only methods (PCA, AUC=0.58, and ENFA, AUC=0.66), but this difference was not statistically significant, except between the MARS and the PCA models. The four models showed an influence of both topographical and hydrological factors, but the resulting habitat suitability maps differed. The core habitat on the continental slope was well highlighted by the four models, while GLM and MARS maps also showed a suitable habitat in the offshore waters. Presence--absence methods are therefore recommended for modelling the habitat suitability of cetaceans, as they seem more accurate to highlight complex habitat. However, the use of presence-only techniques, in particular ENFA, could be very useful for a first model of the habitat range or when important surveys at sea are not possible.},

  Abstract                 = {The rapido is a towed gear used only in the Adriatic Sea for fishing scallops in sandy offshore areas and flatfish in muddy inshore areas. The gear is expected to have a high impact on the entire benthic community, mainly on epifauna and organisms living in the upper sediment layers. To obtain information on likely medium- to long-term effects of trawl fishing in the northern Adriatic Sea, an experiment on immediate/short-term effects was carried out in an undisturbed sandy area near a wreck. The rapido produced flat tracks on the bottom that were still clearly visible after a week by means of sidescan sonar. The trawl did not change the sediment grain size, although it did disturb the upper 6 cm of sediment. Experimental trawling induced a modification in the macrobenthic community that was most evident immediately after the haul. Changes to the meiobenthic community were probably due to sediment disturbance and were recorded after 1 week. Comparison between an undisturbed control area and a neighbouring commercially exploited area allowed some evaluation of long-term changes in the benthic community.

  abstract = {The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

  Abstract                 = {An experimental study of the effects of otter trawling was conducted in a deep (120 to 146 m) sandy bottom ecosystem of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland from 1993 to 1995. Each year, three 13 km long corridors were trawled 12 times within 31 to 34 h with an Engel 145 otter trawl equipped with rockhopper foot gear. The width of the disturbance zones created was on the order of 120 to 250 m. The total biomass of invertebrate bycatch in the trawl decreased significantly over the 12 sets, even though only a very small proportion of the biomass present was removed and each set did not pass over exactly the same area of seabed. An influx of scavenging snow crabs Chionoecetes opilio into the trawled corridors was observed after the first 6 sets (approximately 10 to 12 h). Benthic organ isms in trawled and nearby reference corridors were sampled with an epibenthic sled. Their biomass was on average 24\% lower in trawled corridors than in reference corridors. At the species level, this biomass difference was significant for snow crabs C, opilio, sand dollars Echinarachnius parma, brittle stars Ophiura sarsi, sea urchins Strongylocentrotus pallidus and soft corals Gersemia sp. The reduced biomass of epibenthic organisms in trawled corridors is thought to be due to several interacting factors including direct removal by the trawl, mortality, damage, predation and migration. The homogeneity of the macro-invertebrate community collected by epibenthic sled was lower in trawled corridors. Sand dollars, brittle stars and sea urchins demonstrated significant levels of damage from trawling. The mean individual biomass of epibenthic organisms was lower in trawled corridors suggesting size specific impacts of trawling, especially for sand dollars. No significant effect of trawling was observed in the 4 dominant mollusc species captured by the sled (Astarte borealis, Margarites sordidus, Clinocardium ciliatum and Cyclocardia novangliae). This experiment indicates that otter trawling on a sandy bottom ecosystem can produce detectable changes on both benthic habitat and communities, in particular a significant reduction in the biomass of large epibenthic fauna.},

  Abstract                 = {Habitat destruction has driven many once-contiguous animal populations into remnant patches of varying size and isolation. The underlying framework for the conservation of fragmented populations is founded on the principles of island biogeography, wherein the probability of species occurrence in habitat patches varies as a function of patch size and isolation. Despite decades of research, the general importance of patch area and isolation as predictors of species occupancy in fragmented terrestrial systems remains unknown because of a lack of quantitative synthesis. Here, we compile occupancy data from 1,015 bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian, and invertebrate population networks on 6 continents and show that patch area and isolation are surprisingly poor predictors of occupancy for most species. We examine factors such as improper scaling and biases in species representation as explanations and find that the type of land cover separating patches most strongly affects the sensitivity of species to patch area and isolation. Our results indicate that patch area and isolation are indeed important factors affecting the occupancy of many species, but properties of the intervening matrix should not be ignored. Improving matrix quality may lead to higher conservation returns than manipulating the size and configuration of remnant patches for many of the species that persist in the aftermath of habitat destruction.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to quantities of interest to management is problematic. The arguments of the paper are illustrated using New Zealand’s western stock of hoki, Macruronus novaezelandiae (Merlucciidae) and the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales as examples.},

  Abstract                 = {The endangered Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) has undergone a severe decline during recent decades. Capercaillies require large tracts of mature forest, and are thus sensitive to landscape-level habitat alteration. The high degree of fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbances in the habitat of Cantabrian capercaillie suggested that habitat patterns may be related to the population decline. To evaluate this we developed predictive habitat suitability models. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate environmental variables and spatial context into two logistic models, comparing (a) presence vs. pseudo-absence habitat units (General model) and (b) presence vs. abandoned habitat units (Decline model). We obtained low overall habitat suitability and poor connectivity between high-suitability areas. We found evidence that habitat suitability is indirectly related to the process of population decline, and that the relationship between capercaillie presence and habitat configuration goes beyond the local spatial scale and the average size of forest fragments. We suggest that the combination of these two modelling procedures provides a deeper insight into the decline process, differentiating overall optimal and suboptimal areas (General model) and predicting the direction of eventual local extinctions (Decline model).},

The trawling effort was widely distributed but was intensive only in small and localised areas. Three measures of effort were compared tow frequency, tow duration and separate estimates of swept area for otter boards and trawls. In each year, the area swept with otter trawl was 1.7 times greater than the total area in which fishing occurred over the 7 year period. In contrast, the area swept with otter boards was 4\% of the total fishing area. Most of the fishing effort was confined to depths shallower than 400 m. With increasing depth, the size of trawls became larger and also the area swept per haul. Calculations assuming no variation in the size of the trawl in relation to depth, produced inaccurate swept area estimates, Furthermore, swept area estimates based on depth corrected door spreads were greater than estimates where no much correction was made. Swept area was considered to be a more appropriate measure of effort than tow frequency and tow duration as long as variation in the size of the gear (e.g. in relation to depth) was taken into account. Effort within Icelandic waters was compared in five depth strata within seven zones. Effort was highest off the south and NW coasts and lowest off the north and east coasts. Effort was most intensive at the 100-500 in depth in all zones but in some areas (such as off NW Iceland), effort extended to deeper waters. Knowledge of the distribution of fishing effort is important for predicting larger scale effects of fishing gears on benthic communities.},

There were significant differences among both age-sex classes and months in the harmonic mean distance deviation. For all three measures, juvenile males tended to move the greatest distances. Adult males tended to be more sedentary than adult females over the short term, but traveled over greater distances in the long term. Individuals within age-sex classes had different movement patterns, and individuals often had different movement patterns during the same month in successive years.

Declines in TP were evident at the majority of sites (68%), including those both with (n = 49) and without (n = 64) upstream municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTP). Although declines in TP at stream stations downstream of MWWTPs may be attributed to improvements in P removal from treated effluent, declines at the remaining streams must be attributed to other causes. During the same time period, increases in chloride (Cl-) were observed at almost all (95%) of the 64 MWWTP-free stations. Over the past 35 years, urban land cover has increased at the expense of agricultural land area in Ontario, with the majority of these changes occurring in southern Ontario. The coincidence of declines in TP and increases in Cl- at the 64 MWWTP-free streams suggests that the two may be related, with P-rich agricultural fields being replaced with impervious surfaces and therefore increased road salt applications.},

Using a combination of multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and derivative products produced highest overall accuracy (87%) and kappa statistic (0.83). This study demonstrates that decision tree classifiers are capable of integrating variable data types for mapping distributions of benthic biological assemblages, which are important in maintaining biodiversity and other system services in the marine environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Graph theory, network theory, and circuit theory are increasingly being used to quantify multiple aspects of habitat connectivity and protected areas. There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of “route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches” and “route redundancy at the level of network components.” We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Aim - Existing climate envelope models give an indication of broad scale shifts in distribution, but do not specifically provide information on likely future population changes useful for conservation prioritization and planning. We demonstrate how these techniques can be developed to model likely future changes in absolute density and population size as a result of climate change. 
Location - Great Britain. 
Methods - Generalized linear models were used to model breeding densities of two northerly- and two southerly-distributed bird species as a function of climate and land use. Models were built using count data from extensive national bird monitoring data and incorporated detectability to estimate absolute abundance. Projections of likely future changes in the distribution and abundance of these species were made by applying these models to projections of future climate change under two emissions scenarios. 
Results - Models described current spatial variation in abundance for three of the four species and produced modelled current estimates of national populations that were similar to previously published estimates for all species. Climate change was projected to result in national population declines in the two northerly-distributed species, with declines for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata projected to be particularly severe. Conversely, the abundances of the two southerly distributed species were projected to increase nationally. Projected maps of future abundance may be used to identify priority areas for the future conservation of each species. 
Main conclusions - The analytical methods provide a framework to make projections of impacts of climate change on species abundance, rather than simply projected range changes. Outputs may be summarized at any spatial scale, providing information to inform future conservation planning at national, regional and local scales. Results suggest that as a consequence of climate change, northerly distributed bird species in Great Britain are likely to become an increasingly high conservation priority within the UK.},

  Abstract                 = {* 1An important target for conservation planning is the minimum amount of habitat needed in a landscape to ensure the persistence of a species. Appropriate targets can be determined by identifying thresholds in the amount of habitat, below which persistence, abundance or occupancy declines rapidly. Although some studies have identified habitat thresholds, we currently have little understanding of the extent to which thresholds vary spatially. This is important for establishing whether we can apply the same planning targets across broad geographical regions. * 2We quantified habitatâ€“occupancy relationships for the koala Phascolarctos cinereus (Goldfuss) in three study regions that span much of its geographical range. Standard and piecewise (broken-stick/segmented) logistic regression were used to model linear and threshold habitatâ€“occupancy relationships. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test: (1) whether habitatâ€“occupancy relationships were described better by threshold or linear models and (2) where threshold models were better, whether, and to what extent, threshold points varied among study regions. * 3There was substantially greater support for the threshold than the linear models across a range of habitat qualities and landscape extents. The threshold models generally predicted a rapid decline in occupancy below the threshold points. * 4Estimated threshold points varied, sometimes substantially, among study regions. This may relate to cross-regional differences in habitat quality, demographic rates, and land-use patterns. The role of habitat fragmentation is unclear. * 5Synthesis and applications. Variation in threshold points among study regions suggests that we should be wary of using thresholds derived in one region for setting conservation planning targets in another. Rather, we should aim to set specific targets for individual locations (and species), while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in these targets. This has implications for our ability to make general conservation prescriptions for widely distributed species. Future research should aim to develop generic models capable of predicting threshold responses across different landscapes and life-history characteristics.},

The control process in this loop is the management plan that regulates future fisheries, consistent with objectives of managers. Implementation uncertainty occurs when provisions of management plans fail to have the intended consequences (i.e., when the control process in the loop fails). One reason for failure is that industry works within its own feedback loop; fishing activities change according to the objectives and past experience of industry as well as to the provisions of management plans. If the objectives of industry differ substantially from the objectives of management, the management control process can be ineffective. We illustrate operation of the management and industry feedback loops using the trawl fishery for rockfish (Scorpaenidae) off British Columbia, Canada, where implementation uncertainty was high, and objectives of neither management nor industry were achieved. Addressing this source of implementation uncertainty directly is necessary to create an environment in which both conservation and economic objectives can be met.},

Here, describe some consequences of this management approach on the fishery for Pacific ocean perch Sebastes alutus off* British Columbia. Before the implementation of trip limits, vessels regularly landed catches over metric tons (tonnes). 1992, vessels fishing ground were restricted to Pacific ocean perch landings less than 4.5 tonnes. Thus, trip limits have redistributed effort the fishery, and a relatively constant annual catch is now attained through an increasing number smaller trips. However, some catch excess trip limit known misreported catch of other species; the discarding of excess catch at sea also occurs. Consequently, the catch and catch-per-unit-effbrt (CPUE) data required for stock assessment are underestimated. In particular, CPUE is positively correlated with the trip limit. Managers should consider the detrimental impact of trip limits on fishery-dependent abundance indices when new trip limits were implemented. Improved catch reporting and fishery-independent abundance indices could provide more accurate assessments.hai},

  Abstract                 = {Identification of critical habitat is a key step in conservation and recovery of endangered and threatened freshwater fish. Critical habitat under Canadian and US legislation may include habitat that is not directly used by listed fish, provided it is necessary for species conservation or recovery. Riparian habitat meets biological criteria for critical habitat because riparian zones are integral to aquatic ecosystem functions of importance to many fish species and other organisms. These functions include provision of shade for temperature-sensitive species, control of channel complexity and sediment inputs through bank stabilization, input of large wood and allochthonous energy sources, and filtering of nutrients and toxins from adjacent land. In response to decades of stream-riparian research, widespread implementation of regulations to protect riparian zones in most developed countries represent a de facto consensus that riparian buffers are essential for aquatic ecosystem health and the maintenance of populations of fish and other species. Consistent with widespread riparian regulations deemed necessary to protect not-at-risk species, riparian habitat adjacent to a body of water containing a listed freshwater species should be considered biologically critical unless the habitat requirements of individual taxa are demonstrated to be insensitive to the ecological functions associated with riparian habitat.},

  abstract  = {Aim When considering multiple species in distribution models, environmental variables should be selected that describe the group of species' environmental requirements. This can, however, be challenging in locations such as coastal areas, where different species may respond to terrestrial, oceanic and/or atmospheric conditions. Here, we evaluate the use of remotely sensed (RS) terrestrial, oceanic and interpolated climate variables, as well as a more detailed shore-zone data set, as a means of modelling the distributions of coastal bird species with diverse habitat requirements.
Location Coastal British Columbia, Canada.
Methods Boosted regression trees were used to model the distributions of 60 species of coastal birds using each environmental variable group, run individually and in combination. Models were assessed for their predictive ability and model fit, as well as for model overfitting.
Results Models that incorporated terrestrial data were found to produce the highest model fit and predictive ability of the broad-scale environmental groups. Incorporating the fine-scale shore-zone data offered little improvement, as did selecting the best model in terms of predictive ability by species. Model fit and predictive ability were also found to vary by functional feeding group, with insectivores and benthivores being the best-modelled.
Main conclusions Having access to both broad-scale RS environmental data and more detailed coastal shore-zone data produced modest improvements over employing RS environmental data alone. Models using only the terrestrial data set, however, performed similarly to the best single model type (terrestrial + shore-zone), indicating that broad-scale environmental data also offer an effective means of estimating coastal bird distributions. Testing multiple environmental variable groups in different combinations and selecting the best model allowed models to be optimized by species; conversely, the results of a ‘one model fits all’ approach were comparable to those of the best models, indicating that a single-model approach is also valid.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of regression situations in fish and fishery biology are examined, in which both of the variates are subject to error of measurement, or inherent variability, or both. For most of these situations a functional regression line is more suitable than the ordinary predictive regressions that have usually been employed, so that many estimates now in use are in some degree biased. Examples are (1) estimation of the exponent in the weight:length relationship, where almost all published values are somewhat too small; and (2) estimating the regression of logarithm of metabolic rate on log body weight of fish, where the best average figure proves to be 0.85 rather than 0.80. In the very common situation where the distribution of the variates is non-normal and open-ended, a functional regression is the most appropriate one even for purposes of prediction. Two ways of estimating the functional regression are (1) from arithmetic means of segments of the distribution, when computed symmetrically; and (2) from the geometric mean of one predictive regression and the reciprocal of the other. The GM regression gives a more accurate estimate when it is applicable; it is appropriate in all situations where the variability is mainly inherent in the material (little of it due to errors of measurement), or where the measurement variances are approximately proportional to the total variance of each variate; and it is the best estimate available for short series with moderate or large variability even when neither of these conditions applies. When error in X results solely from the measuring process the predictive regression of Y on X is also the functional regression if observations of X are not taken at random but rather have pre-established values, as is usual in experimental work. The uses of the various regressions are summarized in Table 8.},

At stock densities beyond the apex, reproduction declines either gradually or abruptly. This decline gives a population a tendency to oscillate in numbers; however, the oscillations are damped, not permanent, unless reproduction decreases quite rapidly and there is not too much mixing of generations in the breeding population. Removal of part of the adult stock reduces the amplitude of oscillations that may be in progress and, up to a point, increases reproduction.},

  abstract  = {The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45–60% of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas.},

  abstract  = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to address a wide range of theoretical and applied questions in the terrestrial realm, but marine-based applications remain relatively scarce. In this review, we consider how conceptual and practical issues associated with terrestrial SDMs apply to a range of marine organisms and highlight the challenges relevant to improving marine SDMs. 
Location We include studies from both marine and terrestrial systems that encompass many geographic locations around the globe. 
Methods We first performed a literature search and analysis of marine and terrestrial SDMs in ISI Web of Science to assess trends and applications. Using knowledge from terrestrial applications, we critically evaluate the application of SDMs in marine systems in the context of ecological factors (dispersal, species interactions, aggregation and ontogenetic shifts) and practical considerations (data quality, alternative modelling approaches and model validation) that facilitate or create difficulties for model application. Results 
The relative importance of ecological factors to be considered when applying SDMs varies among terrestrial and marine organisms. Correctly incorporating dispersal is frequently considered an important issue for terrestrial models, but because there is greater potential for dispersal in the ocean, it is often less of a concern in marine SDMs. By contrast, ontogenetic shifts and feeding have received little attention in terrestrial SDM applications, but these factors are important to many marine SDMs. Opportunities also exist for applying more advanced SDM approaches in the marine realm, including mechanistic ecophysiological models, where water balance and heat transfer equations are simpler for some marine organisms relative to their terrestrial counterparts. 
Main conclusions SDMs have generally been under-utilized in the marine realm relative to terrestrial applications. Correlative SDM methods should be tested on a range of marine organisms, and we suggest further development of methods that address ontogenetic shifts and feeding interactions. We anticipate developments in, and cross-fertilization between, coupled correlative and process-based SDMs, mechanistic eco-physiological SDMs, and spatial population dynamic models for climate change and species invasion applications in particular. Comparisons of the outputs of different model types will provide insight that is useful for improved spatial management of marine species.},

This fleet consists of three metiers, benthic trawlers, Gadoid trawlers and Nephrops trawlers. The fleet discarded an estimated 30 000 tons of animals in 1997, while landing 63 000 tons. The total quantity discarded did not differ among mtiers, but the species composition of discards did. Benthic trawlers discarded mainly by-catch species, whereas Gadoid and Nephrops trawlers discarded primarily their target species. Whiting, megrim, Nephrops and hake were discarded in larger numbers than landed. Hence discards should be taken into account in catch-based assessments. However, discards were found to be highly variable between trips and between years. In addition, no reliable auxiliary variable could be found when various factors were investigated to explain the quantities of commercial species discarded. The only explanatory factor valid for any species was the smallest size of that species in the catch. Hence there is a need for regular sampling of discards.},

  abstract  = {Settlement and recruitment of benthic marine invertebrates are complex processes, determined by the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors which operate at different temporal and spatial scales. This review analyses the settlement process, attempting to integrate aspects related to different levels of organization (i.e. ecological-physiological-molecular). This is important because many factors that act at any of these levels and at different times can explain by themselves the patterns of settlement andlor recruitment of a large number of species. From an ecological perspective, progress has been made in the identification of causal factors of vanations in larval availability for settlement. Many physical and ethological factors that act during settlement have, however, not received much attention. Likewise, since the great majority of settlement studies have been carried out at restricted spatial scales, fewer works consider different biological and physical factors acting at different scales simultaneously. Settlement patterns are frequently inferred from recruitment. In this sense, a density-independent action of post-settlement mortality has been cons~dered as prerequisite for thls type of inference. This has, however, recently been challenged on the basis that settler-recruit and mortality-settler density relationships change in time. At the physiological-molecular level, different settlement-inducing chemical cues have been identified. Those cues have, however, not yet been characterized to understand better the signal transduction mechanisms involved in larval responses. It is likely that the nervous system is involved. The use of artificial inducers would be useful in studying settlement induction, until more effective natural inducers are isolated and characterized Although few studies have analysed the acquisition of competence, stages of larval development have been related to changes in protein patterns or enzymatic levels of the nervous system. An inopportune exposure of larvae to inducers may delay settlement and may even have a negative impact on growth and subsequent survival of juvelines.},

This surpasses the 10% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress, for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes1. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned. In practice, however, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity. We show that the global network is far from complete, and demonstrate the inadequacy of uniform—that is, ‘one size fits all’—conservation targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs arise from management choices made by humans, which can change the type, magnitude, and relative mix of services provided by ecosystems. Trade-offs occur when the provision of one ES is reduced as a consequence of increased use of another ES. In some cases, a trade-off may be an explicit choice; but in others, trade-offs arise without premeditation or even awareness that they are taking place. Trade-offs in ES can be classified along three axes: spatial scale, temporal scale, and reversibility. Spatial scale refers to whether the effects of the trade-off are felt locally or at a distant location. Temporal scale refers to whether the effects take place relatively rapidly or slowly. Reversibility expresses the likelihood that the perturbed ES may return to its original state if the perturbation ceases. Across all four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios and selected case study examples, trade-off decisions show a preference for provisioning, regulating, or cultural services in that order). Supporting services are more likely to be “taken for granted.” Cultural ES are almost entirely unquantified in scenario modeling; therefore, the calculated model results do not fully capture losses of these services that occur in the scenarios. The quantitative scenario models primarily capture the services that are perceived by society as more important - provisioning and regulating ecosystem services - and thus do not fully capture trade-offs of cultural and supporting services. Successful management policies will be those that incorporate lessons learned from prior decisions into future management actions. Managers should complement their actions with monitoring programs that, in addition to monitoring the short-term provisions of services, also monitor the long-term evolution of slowly changing variables. Policies can then be developed to take into account ES trade-offs at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Successful strategies will recognize the inherent complexities of ecosystem management and will work to develop policies that minimize the effects of ES trade-offs.},

  Abstract                 = {In Canada, as in other large forested countries of the world, managers and scientists alike question what can happen to forest biodiversity under long-term industrial forest management. Recent studies may help us understand how species react when habitat is lost past a certain threshold in the landscape. In the case of population, a “critical threshold for habitat” does exist in forested habitat, which is defined by the minimal proportion of habitat needed to be preserved to avoid drastic population declines or massive species loss. In this paper, two types of thresholds are described, the first refers to population, and the second refers to the community of species. Many ecologists agree with the assumption that the specialist, sensitive species are the first to disappear (local extirpation for specialist species). For most species with large home range (such as birds), the threshold may generally be located between 30% and 40% of the habitat still remaining, compared to the proportion observed under a natural disturbance regime. We suggest, in order to protect the most sensitive species and to deal with uncertainty associated with thresholds, to maintain at least 40% of residual habitats. Although there is still much to understand concerning these thresholds, we nevertheless recommend their use for the diagnostic analysis that must be performed in the context of forest management planning and biodiversity conservation, as these thresholds could represent the minimal proportion of habitat to preserve integrity of the forest ecosystem. However, to be effective, the application of thresholds should be based on detailed knowledge of ecosystem characteristics and dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the key concerns in conservation is to document and predict the effects of habitat loss on species richness. To do this, the species–area relationship (SAR) is frequently used. That relationship assumes random patterns of habitat loss and species distributions. In nature, however, species distribution patterns are usually nonrandom, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Likewise, socioeconomic and environmental factors influence habitat loss and are not randomly distributed across landscapes. We used a recently developed SAR model that accounts for nonrandomness to predict rates of bird species loss in fragmented forests of the Panama Canal region, an area that was historically covered in forest but now has 53% forest cover. Predicted species loss was higher than that predicted by the standard SAR. Furthermore, a species loss threshold was evident when remaining forest cover declined by 25%. This level of forest cover corresponds to 40% of the historical forest cover, and our model predicts rapid species loss past that threshold. This study illustrates the importance of considering patterns of species distributions and realistic habitat loss scenarios to develop better estimates of losses in species richness. Forecasts of tropical biodiversity loss generated from simple species–area relationships may underestimate actual losses because nonrandom patterns of species distributions and habitat loss are probably not unique to the Panama Canal region.},

  abstract  = {A method that links acoustic mapping data to underwater video observations of seafloor substrate is described for use in defining fish habitat. Three study areas in the Aleutian Islands were acoustically mapped using sidescan and multibeam sonar. The sidescan sonar data were used to compute average reflectivity (hardness) and seafloor complexity. The multibeam depth data were used to determine local slope, rugosity (seafloor roughness) and relative height. Underwater video was collected from three to four transects in each of the three study areas. The underwater video was used to classify the seafloor into nine observed primary and secondary substrate classes. A statistical relationship between the observed (video) and the remotely sensed (acoustic) seafloor characteristics was estimated using a classification tree. The best classification tree utilized rugosity, reflectivity and complexity data and produced misclassification rates of less than 25% overall. Mean grain size of sediment samples was not strongly related to the acoustic data. Error rates were highest for those substrate classes with the smallest number of data points. The results highlight the need for adequate sample sizes and coverage of all potential substrate types when groundtruthing acoustic maps.},

Effects of habitat on population limitation scale from (i) effects on performance of individuals (growth, survival, fecundity) within a life history stage, to (ii) limitation of populations by habitats associated with specific life history stages, and (iii) larger-scale habitat structure required for metapopulation persistence. The minimum subset of habitats required to achieve a recovery target will depend on the extent, quality, and spatial configuration of habitats available to sequential life history stages. Although populations may be limited by available habitat for a single life history stage, altering habitat quality for subsequent stages will also affect individual survival and population size, providing multiple leverage points within a life history for habitat management to achieve recovery targets. When habitat-explicit demographic data are lacking, consequences of uncertainty in critical habitat assessment need to be explicit, and research should focus on identifying habitats most likely to be limiting based on species biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The adoption of endangered species laws in various nations has intensified efforts to better understand, and protect, at-risk species or populations, and their habitats. In many countries, delineating a portion of a species' habitat as particularly worthy of protection has become a mantra of these laws. Unfortunately, the laws themselves often provide scientists and managers with few, if any, guidelines for how to define such habitat. Conservationists and scientists may view protecting part of the habitat of an endangered species as an ineffectual compromise, while managers may be under pressure to allow a range of human activities within the species' habitat. In the case of small cetaceans, establishing boundaries for such areas can also be complicated by their mobility, the fluid nature of their environment, and the often ephemeral nature of their habitat features. The convergence of multiple human impacts in coastal waters around the world is impacting many small cetaceans (and other species) that rely on these areas for feeding, reproducing, and resting. The ten guiding principles presented here provide a means to characterize the habitat needs of small, at-risk cetaceans, and serve as a basis for the delineation of [`]priority habitat' boundaries. This conceptual approach should facilitate a constructive discourse between scientists and managers engaged in efforts to recover endangered species. The degree to which the recovery of an at-risk species can be reconciled with sustainable economic activity will depend in part on how well these principles are incorporated into the delineation of priority habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {Active adaptive management (AAM) is an approach to wildlife management that acknowledges our imperfect understanding of natural systems and allows for some resolution of our uncertainty. Such learning may be characterized by risky strategies in the short term. Experimentation is only considered acceptable if it is expected to be repaid by increased returns in the long term, generated by an improved understanding of the system. By setting AAM problems within a decision theory framework, we can find this optimal balance between achieving our objectives in the short term and learning for the long term.We apply this approach to managing the translocation of the bridled nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata), an endangered species from Queensland, Australia. Our task is to allocate captive-bred animals, between two sites or populations to maximize abundance at the end of the translocation project. One population, at the original site of occupancy, has a known growth rate. A population potentially could be established at a second site of suitable habitat, but we can only learn the growth rate of this new population by monitoring translocated animals. We use a mathematical programming technique called stochastic dynamic programming, which determines optimal management decisions for every possible management trajectory. We find optimal strategies under active and passive adaptive management, which enables us to examine the balance between learning and managing directly. Learning is more often optimal when we have less prior information about the uncertain population growth rate at the new site, when the growth rate at the original site is low, and when there is substantial time remaining in the translocation project. Few studies outside the area of optimal harvesting have framed AAM within a decision theory context. This is the first application to threatened species translocation.},

I used latent class analysis to partition responses from a national Internet-based survey that asked respondents about their preferred conservation program from amongst scenarios that varied according to target species (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, Atlantic whitefish Coregonus huntsmani, leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis, porbeagle shark Lamna nasus, and white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus), program performance, cost, and method of payment. The large sample of the Canadian public (n = 2761) cleaved into 9 distinct segments that varied significantly in their patterns of preferences. Mean implicit prices, calculated using regression coefficients, ranged as high as CAD $85.99 annually for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. There was strong support for programs that had a high probability of success even though increases in population abundance and improvements in listing status were each only significant for 4 of the 9 segments. I also found evidence that members of 1 segment were unwilling or unable to make tradeoffs between the program attributes (i.e. they exhibited ‘lexicographic preferences’). Members from all 9 segments were distributed across Canada, implying that the proper geographic scope of benefits assessments should be expanded beyond the regions in which regional aquatic species at risk actually occur. These findings should help ensure that the broad societal benefits of conservation are captured when making endangered species listing and investment decisions in Canada in the future.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  Abstract                 = {Abundance estimates of wild and hatchery Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are important for evaluation of stock status and density-dependent interactions at sea. We assembled available salmon catch and spawning abundance data for both Asia and North America and reconstructed total abundances of pink salmon O. gorbuscha, chum salmon O. keta, and sockeye salmon O. nerka during 1952–2005. Abundance trends were evaluated with respect to species, regional stock groups, and climatic regimes. Wild adult pink salmon were the most numerous salmon species (average 268x10^6 fish/year, or 70% of the total abundance of the three species), followed by sockeye salmon (63x10^6 fish/year, or 17%) and chum salmon (48x10^6 fish/year, or 13%). After the 1976–1977 ocean regime shift, abundances of wild pink salmon and sockeye salmon increased by more than 65% on average, whereas abundance of wild chum salmon was lower in recent decades. Although wild salmon abundances in most regions of North America increased in the late 1970s, abundances in Asia typically did not increase until the 1990s. Annual releases of juvenile salmon from hatcheries increased rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s and reached approximately 4.5x10^9 juveniles/year during the 1990s and early 2000s. During 1990–2005, annual production of hatchery-origin adult salmon averaged 78x10^6 chum salmon, 54x10^6 pink salmon, and 3.2x10^6 sockeye salmon, or approximately 62, 13, and 4%, respectively, of the combined total wild and hatchery salmon abundance. The combined abundance of adult wild and hatchery salmon during 1990–2005 averaged 634 3 106 salmon/year (498x10^6 wild salmon/year), or approximately twice as many as during 1952–1975. The large and increasing abundances of hatchery salmon have important management implications in terms of density-dependent processes and conservation of wild salmon populations; management agencies should improve estimates of hatchery salmon abundance in harvests and on the spawning grounds.},

Using classification and regression tree analysis (CART), we compared two periods (1991-1995 and 1998-2004) with contrasting bottom temperature and salinity regimes to determine regional factors that best explained cod distribution and catch weight per tow from summer surveys in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (the feeding period of cod). The classification tree analysis indicated that the presence or absence of cod was chiefly determined by depth in both of these periods. In contrast, the regression tree analysis determined that cod catch weight distributions were explained by different variables in each period. In the colder period (1991-1995), the distribution of catch weights was explained well by environmental variables (bottom temperature, salinity, depth); however, in the warmer period (1998-2004), distributions were best explained by variables from the previous year. These results indicate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental conditions are likely to influence the loyalty of cod to specific feeding grounds and imply that cod responses to the environment could be susceptible to long-term environmental (e.g., bottom-habitat) and climate change},

  Abstract                 = {In its capacity to lead and facilitate the development and implementation of integrated management plans under the 1997 Oceans Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is working with a range of stakeholders through a collaborative process--the Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative--to develop and implement an integrated ocean management plan for the eastern Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia. Stakeholders include federal and provincial departments, aboriginal communities, municipal and local planning authorities, ocean industry and resource use sectors, coastal communities, environmental interest groups, and university researchers. This large ocean management area possesses important living and non-living marine resources, high biological productivity and diversity, and increasing levels of multiple use and competition for ocean space and resources. The ESSIM vision is to achieve environmental, economic, social/community, and institutional sustainability in the eastern Scotian Shelf. The ESSIM Initiative is building a collaborative planning process that involves all interested and affected parties. Ongoing information sharing and dialogue with stakeholder groups is providing capacity building and important input to current proposals for a collaborative planning structure and the ocean management plan. A joint federal-provincial working group has been established to move the Initiative forward within government and to address policy and regulatory coordination for ocean management. The future ocean management plan will include a balanced set of environmental, social, economic and institutional objectives, indicators and management strategies, as well as spatial and temporal planning approaches to address multiple ocean use. This article provides an overview of the ESSIM Initiative, including an assessment of ocean use, ecosystem understanding, and ocean management and planning requirements. The design of a collaborative management and planning structure and process will be discussed, as well as the key elements of the future integrated ocean management plan.},

  Abstract                 = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a widely used set of tools for evaluating relative extinction risk and prioritizing management options among imperiled populations. While PVA is a widely sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk when species interactions contribute significantly to population viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism, parasitism and host-parasitoid interactions) in population viability analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378 articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with other species. Most of these PVA's treat a putative species interaction as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered. Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct more complex PVA's with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to "escape the population vacuum" in a move toward more realistic estimates of extinction risk.},

The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {An essential foundation of any science is a standard lexicon. Any given conservation project can be described in terms of the biodiversity targets, direct threats, contributing factors at the project site, and the conservation actions that the project team is employing to change the situation. These common elements can be linked in a causal chain, which represents a theory of change about how the conservation actions are intended to bring about desired project outcomes. If project teams want to describe and share their work and learn from one another, they need a standard and precise lexicon to specifically describe each node along this chain. To date, there have been several independent efforts to develop standard classifications for the direct threats that affect biodiversity and the conservation actions required to counteract these threats. Recognizing that it is far more effective to have only one accepted global scheme, we merged these separate efforts into unified classifications of threats and actions, which we present here. Each classification is a hierarchical listing of terms and associated definitions. The classifications are comprehensive and exclusive at the upper levels of the hierarchy, expandable at the lower levels, and simple, consistent, and scalable at all levels. We tested these classifications by applying them post hoc to 1191 threatened bird species and 737 conservation projects. Almost all threats and actions could be assigned to the new classification systems, save for some cases lacking detailed information. Furthermore, the new classification systems provided an improved way of analyzing and comparing information across projects when compared with earlier systems. We believe that widespread adoption of these classifications will help practitioners more systematically identify threats and appropriate actions, managers to more efficiently set priorities and allocate resources, and most important, facilitate cross-project learning and the development of a systematic science of conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Enhanced Data Collection Project (EDCP), administered by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, collected data on discard rates for groundfish species and bycatch rates of prohibited species (salmon and Pacific halibut). From late 1995 to early 1999 EDCP observers collected discard data from 235 fishing trips by 25 trawl vessels that voluntarily participated in the program. Besides these observer data, vessels in the program kept enhanced logbooks that recorded retained and discarded catch. These logbooks had data from 866 trips by 44 vessels, including most of the trips with observers. Provided logbook data are acceptably accurate, collecting discard data using logbooks could be a cost-effective supplement to an observer program for measuring discard rates and total discards. Comparisons of tow-by-tow logbook discards with the corresponding observer discards indicated substantial inaccuracies in the logbook information. However, when averaged across tows, trips, and vessels, the discard rates (discard/catch) from the logbooks were lower than the observer discard rates, but predictably so. Generalized linear models were used to determine the major factors contributing to variability in the discard rates. The models indicated tremendous vessel-to-vessel variability in discard rates. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to trip-level landings and species compositions from the entire groundfish trawl fleet to summarize the fleet-wide characteristics of fishing trips. Analyses of the PCA scores from the trips that were in the EDCP compared to the scores from all other trips indicated that the EDCP trips probably were not representative of the fleet at large.},

However, there is a general regression of these meadows due to human activities such as illegal bottom trawling, may be affecting to overall ecosystem health. We examined changes in the community structure of mobile fauna associated with P. oceanica meadows at different spatial scales and taxonomic levels. The aim of this paper was to identify the most efficient taxonomic level to use in environmental impact studies of bottom trawling. At the macroscale level (10 to 100 m), there were significant differences between sites in the densities of some fish species and also the total fish assemblage structure, at both family and species taxonomical levels. At the microscale (0.1 to 1 m), some species of amphipods and isopods showed significant differences in their population densities. In the overall analysis of community structure, the coarse taxonomical levels, such as phyla and class, did not show significant differences, however amphipods and isopods showed significant differences at family and species levels. From these results, both study scales are required to detect changes on Posidonia meadows' fauna. Monitoring of some fish species such as Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758) and the overall fish assemblage as well as the structure of the amphipod and isopod communities appears to be the most efficient tool in the assessment of environmental impacts by bottom trawling on P. oceanica meadows.},

Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers, industry representatives, and brokers, literature review, and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk. Contrary to some opinions, these programs are evidence that it is possible to implement IFQ programs for multispecies fisheries and that they can be profitable and sustainable.},

  Abstract                 = {Species extinctions and the deterioration of other biodiversity features worldwide have led to the adoption of systematic conservation planning in many regions of the world. As a consequence, various software tools for conservation planning have been developed over the past twenty years. These tools implement algorithms designed to identify conservation area networks for the representation and persistence of biodiversity features. Budgetary, ethical, and other sociopolitical constraints dictate that the prioritized sites represent biodiversity with minimum impact on human interests. Planning tools are typically also used to satisfy these criteria. This chapter reviews both the concepts and technical choices that underlie the development of these tools. Conservation planning problems can be formulated as optimization problems, and we evaluate the suitability of different algorithms for their solution. Finally, we also review some key issues associated with the use of these tools, such as computational efficiency, the effectiveness of taxa and abiotic parameters at choosing surrogates for biodiversity, the process of setting explicit targets of representation for biodiversity surrogates, and dealing with multiple criteria. The review concludes by identifying areas for future research, including the scheduling of conservation action over extensive time periods and incorporating data about site vulnerability.},

  abstract  = {Ecosystems are linked within landscapes by the physical and biological processes they mediate. In such connected landscapes, the response of one ecosystem to climate change could have profound consequences for neighbouring systems. Here, we report the first quantitative predictions of interdependencies between ecosystems in response to climate change. In shallow tropical marine ecosystems, coral reefs shelter lagoons from incoming waves, allowing seagrass meadows to thrive. Deepening water over coral reefs from sea-level rise results in larger, more energetic waves traversing the reef into the lagoon, potentially generating hostile conditions for seagrass. However, growth of coral reef such that the relative water depth is maintained could mitigate negative effects of sea-level rise on seagrass. Parameterizing physical and biological models for Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we find negative effects of sea-level rise on seagrass before the middle of this century given reasonable rates of reef growth. Rates of vertical carbonate accretion typical of modern reef flats (up to 3 mm/yr) will probably be insufficient to maintain suitable conditions for reef lagoon seagrass under moderate to high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios by 2100. Accounting for interdependencies in ecosystem responses to climate change is challenging, but failure to do so results in inaccurate predictions of habitat extent in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Connectivity is a major concern for the maintenance of wildlife populations, ecological flows, and many other landscape functions. For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas.},

Here we describe the new Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software, which quantifies the importance of habitat patches for maintaining or improving functional landscape connectivity and is conceived as a tool for decision-making support in landscape planning and habitat conservation. CS22 is based on graph structures, which have been suggested to possess the greatest benefit to effort ratio for conservation problems regarding landscape connectivity. CS22 includes new connectivity metrics based on the habitat availability concept, which considers a patch itself as a space where connectivity occurs, integrating in a single measure the connected habitat area existing within the patches with the area made available by the connections between different habitat patches. These new metrics have been shown to present improved properties compared to other existing metrics and are particularly suited to the identification of critical landscape elements for connectivity. CS22 is distributed together with GIS extensions that allow for directly generating the required input files from a GIS layer. CS22 and related documentation can be freely downloaded from the World Wide Web.},

  Abstract                 = {1The addition of large water storage dams to rivers in California's Central Valley blocked access to spawning habitat and has resulted in a dramatic decline in the distribution and abundance of spring-run chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum 1792). Successful recovery efforts depend on an understanding of the historical spatial structure of these populations, which heretofore has been lacking.

2 Graph theory was used to examine the spatial structure and demographic connectivity of riverine populations of spring-run chinook salmon. Standard graph theoretic measures, including degree, edge weight and node strength, were used to uncover the role of individual populations in this network, i.e. which populations were sources and which were pseudo-sinks. 
3 Larger spatially proximate populations, most notably the Pit River, served as sources in the historic graph. These source populations in the graph were marked by an increased number of stronger outbound connections (edges), and on average had few inbound connections. Of the edges in the current graph, seven of them were outbound from a population supported by a hatchery in the Feather River, which suggests a strong influence of the hatchery on the structure of the current extant populations. 
4 We tested how the addition of water storage dams fragmented the graph over time by examining changing patterns in connectivity and demographic isolation of individual populations. Dams constructed in larger spatially proximate populations had a strong impact on the independence of remaining populations. Specifically, the addition of dams resulted in lost connections, weaker remaining connections and an increase in demographic isolation. 
5 A simulation exercise that removed populations from the graph under different removal scenariosÂ â€“Â random removal, removal by decreasing habitat size and removal by decreasing node strengthÂ â€“Â revealed a potential approach for restoration of these depleted populations.

6 Synthesis and applications. Spatial graphs are drawing the attention of ecologists and managers. Here we have used a directed graph to uncover the historical spatial structure of a threatened species, estimate the connectivity of the current populations, examine how the historical network of populations was fragmented over time and provide a plausible mechanism for ecologically successful restoration. The methods employed here can be applied broadly across taxa and systems, and afford scientists and managers a better understanding of the structure and function of impaired ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Map comparison is a relatively uncommon practice in acoustic seabed classification to date, contrary to the field of land remote sensing, where it has been developed extensively over recent decades. The aim here is to illustrate the benefits of map comparison in the underwater realm with a case study of three maps independently describing the seabed habitats of the Te Matuku Marine Reserve (Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand). The maps are obtained from a QTC View classification of a single-beam echosounder (SBES) dataset, manual segmentation of a sidescan sonar (SSS) mosaic, and automatic classification of a backscatter dataset from a multibeam echosounder (MBES). The maps are compared using pixel-to-pixel similarity measures derived from the literature in land remote sensing. All measures agree in presenting the MBES and SSS maps as the most similar, and the SBES and SSS maps as the least similar. The results are discussed with reference to the potential of MBES backscatter as an alternative to SSS mosaic for imagery segmentation and to the potential of joint SBES-SSS survey for improved habitat mapping. Other applications of map-similarity measures in acoustic classification of the seabed are suggested.},

Global macroecological patterns are very different for land and marine species but suggest common mechanisms driving diversity and endemism across systems. Compared with land species, threat levels are higher among marine mammals, driven by different processes (accidental mortality and pollution, rather than habitat loss), and are spatially distinct (peaking in northern oceans, rather than in Southeast Asia).

  Abstract                 = {1. Because predators threaten the survival of endangered prey in many places, predator management is a widespread conservation tool. At the same time, the effects of predators on their prey are greatly influenced by landscape structure. Therefore, the management of landscapes could be an alternative to predator regulation. 2. A spatially explicit presence/absence model (a stochastic one-layer cellular automaton) was used to investigate two different predator-prey systems that were subject to changes in the number and size of habitat patches in a model landscape. 3. The first scenario included grey-sided voles Clethrionomys rufocanus, Norwegian lemmings Lemmus lemmus and small mustelids (stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis) interacting in a tundra landscape. In the second scenario, the effect of habitat perforation by human settlements with subsidized predators (house cats Felis silvestris catus) on the dynamics of lemmings (as surrogate for endangered prey) was studied. 4. Both the total area of lemming habitat and the degree of fragmentation were important determinants of the population size and persistence of lemmings. A qualitative change in the effect of fragmentation was observed when the area of lemming habitat decreased from 70% (positive effect) to 50% (negative effect). When lemming habitat covered 50% or less of the landscape, fragmentation had a negative effect on lemming population size and viability, even though habitat area did not decrease. 5. The spatial configuration of settlements as predator sources was important. A few evenly spaced predator sources had less negative effect on lemming populations than the same proportion of predator habitat that was randomly distributed, which in turn had less effect than many evenly spaced patches. 6. Including predator management in the model did not decrease the predators' negative impact on the population size and persistence of the endangered prey when settlements occurred in many small patches. 7. It is concluded that predator management is not a viable strategy to combat the threat to the survival of endangered prey, but that careful planning of landscape pattern could compensate for negative predation effects. The location and size of patches of predator habitat should be optimized in order to minimize the negative effects of predators visiting adjacent areas of natural habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {For assessment purposes, slope rockfish include seven species: Pacific ocean perch, yellowmouth rockfish, redstripe rockfish, rougheye rockfish, shortspine/longspine thornyheads, and shortraker rockfish. These are managed within six major areas (3C, 3D, 5AB, 5CD, 5ES, 5EN), giving a total of 42 species-area combinations. Historically, these 42 assessment units have been managed with reference to a benchmark stock of Pacific ocean perch in Area 5AB. A catch-at-age analysis of this stock played a central role in the assessment. This assessment differs from past reports in three principle respects. First, we use a new trawl observer database to examine abundance ratios among species and areas. Second, we use information gathered from experienced members of the industry, and we record some of their concerns. Third, we do not include a new catch-at-age analysis of the benchmark stock. No new survey data are available to alter substantially the 1997 analysis.
We draw several conclusions from our analysis of the trawl observer database. First, as stated by industry members, CPUE varies substantially with depth. Second, commercial slope rockfish tows that occur in similar times and places as research survey tows sometimes exhibit lower CPUE profiles in relation to depth, confirming observations by fishermen that a system of IVQs may induce avoidance fishing. Third, analysis of heavily fished blocks shows little evidence of stock depletion, except possibly for longspine thornyheads. Finally, industry abundance estimates conform more closely to recent yield and quota recommendations than to various computed indices based on effort qualification and spatial stratification.
Recognizing the need for further analysis and lacking evidence for substantial change at this time, we recommend that the 1998 yield options be extended to 1999.},

  abstract    = {In May 2011, COSEWIC assessed three designatable units (DU) of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) in Canada: Fraser (endangered), Central Pacific (endangered), and Nass/Skeena (threatened; although this DU is being re-assessed by COSEWIC). In light of these designations, DFO undertook this recovery potential assessment to provide scientific advice in support of considering management scenarios and conducting socioeconomic analyses to inform SARA listing decisions and recovery planning. A lack of consistent long term indices of population abundance made it extremely difficult to determine the recovery potential for these DUs. Indices of in-river abundance were summarized for each DU and examined in relation to time series of putative threats in freshwater and marine environments, at both coastwide and localized scales. No single threat could be identified as most probable for the observed decline in abundances among DUs or in limiting recovery. However, mortality associated with coastwide changes in climate, fishing (direct and bycatch) and marine predation were considered to be greater threats at the DU level, than changes in habitat or predation within spawning rivers.

A Bayesian stock reduction model was developed for the Fraser DU. The analysis suggested that the decline in population abundance could be explained most parsimoniously by the sequential historical impacts of directed in-river catch (prior to 1970), bycatch in the shrimp trawl fishery (1990 to 2000), and several consecutive years of anomalously low productivity (2002-2007 brood years). The model indicates that, under conditions of average historical productivity and current levels of bycatch mortality from shrimp trawling effort but no directed exploitation, the Fraser River population should rebuild to 33-49 percent (range for the three cohorts) of the unfished abundance over a period of 16-18 years. A directed catch of 30 tonnes would reduce rebuilding to 1-30 percent of the unfished population. The analysis suggests that the species is relatively unproductive and can sustain a maximum sustainable fishing mortality rate of only 0.10. Data in the other DUs are sparse but not prohibitive for the development of similar models. One would expect these populations to share similar population dynamics and productivity, and also require a conservative approach to management and rebuilding. Continued monitoring of the Fraser DU is needed to determine whether productivity has returned to average levels and, therefore, permitting of any allowable harm should be considered with caution. A lack of adequate monitoring makes identification of recovery targets for the Fraser and Central Coast DUs difficult, but we recommend an initial goal of surpassing the COSEWIC criteria for special concern listing at a minimum is recommended, with a longer term goal of continued population increases towards historical levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Breiman (2001a,b) has recently developed an ensemble classification and regression approach that displayed outstanding performance with regard prediction error on a suite of benchmark datasets. As the base constituents of the ensemble are tree-structured predictors, and since each of these is constructed using an injection of randomness, the method is called ‘random forests’. That the exceptional performance is attained with seemingly only a single tuning pa- rameter, to which sensitivity is minimal, makes the methodology all the more remarkable. The individual trees comprising the forest are all grown to maximal depth. While this helps with regard bias, there is the familiar tradeoff with variance. However, these variability concerns were potentially obscured because of an interesting feature of those benchmarking datasets extracted from the UCI machine learning repository for testing: all these datasets are hard to overfit using tree-structured methods. This raises issues about the scope of the repository.

With this as motivation, and coupled with experience from boosting methods, we revisit the formulation of random forests and investigate prediction performance on real-world and simu- lated datasets for which maximally sized trees do overfit. These explorations reveal that gains can be realized by additional tuning to regulate tree size via limiting the number of splits and/or the size of nodes for which splitting is allowed. Nonetheless, even in these settings, good performance for random forests can be attained by using larger (than default) primary tuning parameter values.},

  Abstract                 = {Chronic oil pollution or frequent small-scale oil discharges from vessel operations is an important source of marine oil pollution and considered a constant threat to marine and coastal environments. In Canada’s Pacific region, evidence of such illegal discharges has been gathered by the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) from 1998 to 2007. We used this information to fit Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for offshore waters and inshore waters and explore the relationships between oil spill occurrences and four predictor variables: shipping traffic densities for different vessel types, distance to shore, distance to port and density of small harbours. The best-fit models for both regions show that areas closer to shore and with higher density of small harbours have a higher probability of oil spill occurrences. However, only in inshore waters was shipping traffic significantly related with oil spill occurrences. Tug boats and oil tanker traffic show a significant positive relationship with oil spill observations, while carriers presented a negative association. Mapped results for offshore areas depicted the highest probability of oily discharges in Barkley Sound and at the entrance of the Juan de Fuca Strait; whereas in inshore waters, oil pollution hot spots were found in the vicinity of major commercial and tourist centres.
These probability maps were used to identify Coastal and Marine Protected Areas (CMPAs) and Important Bird Areas (IBAs) more likely to be exposed to chronic oil pollution during a period of 10 years. Three areas were highlighted as the most vulnerable based on their likelihood of exposure and the sensitivity of the species they contain to oil pollution. These sites are the Tofino Mudflats, Barkley Sound, Scott Islands and the Sturgeon and Robert Banks, in the Fraser River delta.

Our findings provide better understanding of the relationships between oil spill occurrences and vessel operations and help us identify likely oil pollution hot spots and sites particularly vulnerable to this stressor in Canada’s Pacific region. This information can be useful to NASP in improving its efficiency and in targeting monitoring efforts to troublesome areas. Additionally, this research contributes to regional studies that focus on analyzing the distribution of anthropogenic stressors from sea-based activities in British Columbia. Finally, we highlight the importance of collecting accurate data to properly model the probability of oil spill occurrences and encourage future research aiming to better understand and ultimately reduce the chronic release of pollutants from shipping activities into the marine environment.},

  abstract  = {Biological diversity is quantified for reasons ranging from primer design, to bioprospecting, and community ecology. As a common index for all levels, we suggest Shannon's SH, already used in information theory and biodiversity of ecological communities. Since Lewontin's first use of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has been used for variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and informativeness of pedigrees. However, until now there has been no theory to predict expected values of this index under given genetic and demographic conditions. We present a new null theory for SH at the genetic level, and show that this index has advantages including (i) independence of measures at each hierarchical level of organization; (ii) robust estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of conditions; (iii) ability to incorporate information on population size; and (iv) explicit relationship to standard statistical tests. Utilization of this index in conjunction with other existing indices offers powerful insights into genetic processes. Our genetic theory is also extendible to the ecological community level, and thus can aid the comparison and integration of diversity at the genetic and community levels, including the need for measures of community diversity that incorporate the genetic differentiation between species.},

data available for each lake varied, ranging from intensive multi-year ecosystem studies on some lakes to one-time limnological surveys on others. The lakes are located in five of the six DFO management areas (none are in Yukon-Transboundary). Seventeen of the lakes are in the B.C Interior, eight are in the Central Coast, four are in the Lower Fraser, the majority (25) are in the North Coast, and six are in the South Coast. They make up about two-thirds of the total sockeye nursery lakes in B.C. Their total surface area is 3,586 km2, which is approximately 90% of the total area of B.C. nursery lakes. Freshwater factors limiting sockeye production in these lakes are varied, but in the majority of lakes and years fry recruitment is insufficient to fully utilize their productive capacity. Most of the lakes are oligotrophic and strongly nutrient-limited, thus juvenile sockeye growth and/or survival could be improved by nutrient additions. We identify opportunities for enhancement and restoration of the lakes' sockeye stocks, which in addition to lake fertilization include increasing escapements, fry outplants, spawning channels, improvements to spawning grounds, and control of competitors or predators},

However, the location of boundaries between and composition of habitats is highly dependent on the approach taken to integrate abiotic and biotic information. The purpose of this study was to test #top-down# and #bottom-up# approaches for integrating physical and biological data derived from commonly used sub-tidal benthic mapping tools to create a habitat map compatible with the US Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). We found that a top-down framework, where we tested for differences in macrofauna assemblages among side scan sonar facies, defined two broad-scale and general habitats. Using the bottom-up approach, where patterns in abiotic and biotic variables were examined with multivariate statistics (BEST, LINKTREE, ANOSIM, SIMPER), we generated seven biotopes based on the macrofauna abundance, percent sand, water depth, and backscatter standard deviation that corresponded well to, but provided more fine-scale detail than the top-down habitats. We were able to use the statistical relationship between abiotic variables and macrofauna assemblages in the LINKTREE to predict the spatial distribution of assemblages over ~50% of the study area. We created a local catalogue of biotopes specific to our study area that contributes to the CMECS library. In addition, we were able to fully map CMECS Geoform, Surface Geology, and Biotic Cover Components. This mapping effort represented real progress toward reconciling the #data##density##mismatch# between physical and biological mapping methods, and it provided further evidence that using a bottom-up methodology preserves species-environment relationships.},

Habitat structure on mud-bottom fishing grounds did not differ significantly from that in similar untrawled areas. Moreover, sediment resuspension associated with shrimp trawling did not appear to result in net loss of deposited material on fishing grounds, but there is evidence that trawling may alter sediment mixing regimes. Visual inspection of the sediment surface in trawled areas revealed minimal evidence of fishing gear disturbance (such as door, bobbin, or net marks), but biological disturbance features including numerous large burrows, pits, and dense aggregations of the brittle star Ophiura sarsi, were present in both trawled and untrawled areas. Macrofaunal communities on the two fishing grounds exhibited different responses to shrimp trawling, which were attributed to disparities in levels of fishing activity during the 2000-2001 shrimp season. The results suggest that seasonal shrimp trawling produced at least short-term changes (< 3 months) in macrofaunal community structure, but did not appear to result in long-term cumulative changes. Resilience to trawling disturbance may be due in part to high levels of biological disturbance generated by benthic megafauna, such as lobsters and fish. By burrowing, pit-digging, and possibly foraging, these animals rework sediments to a depth of 16-17 cm, creating a natural level of disturbance that appears to maintain macrofaunal communities in a perpetually low successional state, so potentially minimizing trawling impacts.},

  Abstract                 = {The rarity or absence of highly interactive species leaves a functional void that can trigger linked changes leading to degraded or simplified ecosystems. A preliminary analysis indicates a relatively high frequency of such interactive species among endangered mammals. Rapid environmental change is likely to increase the interactivity of some species and reduce that of others over relatively short intervals. The current implementation of environmental policies and laws, such as the U.S. Endangered Species Act, generally ignores interspecific effects; recovery goals are autecological, short term, and numerically and spatially minimalistic. Moreover, by failing to account for interspecific interactions, recovery objectives are becoming indefensible in light of increasing knowledge from community ecology. Using the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) and wolf (Canis lupus) as examples, we argue that conservation plans should call for recovery or repatriation of such interactive species at ecologically effective densities in as many places as are currently realistic. It will be prudent and beneficial to estimate ecologically effective densities where there is disagreement among experts and interested parties about the desirability of restoring an interactive species to a particular region and to a particular density.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of trawling disturbance on a soft-sediment system were investigated with a manipulative field experiment in an area that had been closed to shrimp trawling activities for 20 years. The area was also chosen for its weak natural physical agents i.e. no scouring of sediments by storm events or tidal flow, allowing a quantitative assessment of the effects of trawling on the benthic fauna and geochemical properties of the soft substrate. The study examined the ambient spatial and temporal patterns of sedimentological variables and benthic species abundances over a time interval of 16 months for both the reference and the trawl stations before dragging the trawling gear over the predetermined trawl sites. Shifts in the patterns of the benthic infauna and geochemical variables were identified by the post-trawl samples that were collected at both the reference and trawl stations over the next 6 months. Post-trawl changes in the bottom topography did not translate into changes in the vertical profile of the sedimentological variables. Chlorophyll a content of the trawled surface sediments was significantly elevated immediately after the trawling event in comparison to the reference concentrations. Immediately after the trawling disturbance, numbers of species, species abundance and diversity decreased in the trawled area in comparison to the reference area. Sensitive species were found to be the bivalves; Ennucula annulata, Hampson, Thyasira flexuosa (Montagu), and Yoldia sapotilla (Gould), and polychaetes; Chaetozone cf.setosa Malmgren, Anobothrus gracilis (Malmgren), Euchone incolor Hartman, and Terebellides atlantis Williams. In contrast, the carnivorous nemertea, Cerebratulus lacteus Verrill, was the resistant species to field manipulations on account of its predatory behavior; highly effective in seeking out freshly dead (dying) organisms and its active migration. Multivariate analysis confirmed the changes in the trawled community structure immediately following the trawling event and differences in the recovery patterns 6 months thereafter. Although the trawling disturbance was one of low frequency and intensity compared to commercial operations, the biological variables studied indicated that successional processes in this soft-bottom community were altered, at least for a short period, in response to the trawling disturbance.},

  Abstract                 = {The British Columbia fishing industry and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada introduced 100% monitoring of the commercial groundfish hook-and-line and trap fisheries in April 2006. The monitoring system includes cameras to capture video footage of hauling at the vessel’s side, Global Positioning System-linked winch sensors on all boats, 100% dockside monitoring of piece counts and weights, and 100% retention of all rockfishes Sebastes spp. The system provides official estimates of total catch in pieces and weight (retained and discarded) through the fisher logs and dockside monitoring. Using catches of yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus as a test case, this study examined the accuracy of catch estimates produced during the third year of the program (April 2008 to March 2009). The analysis indicates that the overall monitoring produces accurate catch estimates of yelloweye rockfish. A key, and possibly unique, component of the catch verification was the derivation of an alternate estimate of total catch. This estimate was derived from the data that result from the video review of randomly selected fishing events. This review process randomly selects 10% of the events from each trip and enumerates the catch of each species during the entire event. Originally designed as a random check on the veracity of the fisher logs, these review data were used in this study to provide an unbiased estimate of mean catch per event and its variance; mean catch per event was then expanded to total catch by the total number of events. Since these data come from video footage collected at the moment of capture, the video estimate cannot be corrupted by misreporting of discards or by dumping fish after being retained. Thus, the video data provide an unbiased and virtually independent catch estimate—rare in fisheries monitoring—that captures the extent to which the official catch accounting systems might be biased.},

Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.RESULTS:We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.CONCLUSION:The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.RESULTS:Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand.CONCLUSION:We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

  Abstract                 = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing.},

  Abstract                 = {A major conservation concern is whether population size and other ecological variables change linearly with habitat loss, or whether they suddenly decline more rapidly below a "critical threshold" level of habitat. The most commonly discussed explanation for critical threshold responses to habitat loss focus on habitat configuration. As habitat loss progresses, the remaining habitat is increasingly fragmented or the fragments are increasingly isolated, which may compound the effects of habitat loss. In this review we also explore other possible explanations for apparently nonlinear relationships between habitat loss and ecological responses, including Allee effects and time lags, and point out that some ecological variables will inherently respond nonlinearly to habitat loss even in the absence of compounding factors. In the literature, both linear and nonlinear ecological responses to habitat loss are evident among simulation and empirical studies, although the presence and value of critical thresholds is influenced by characteristics of the species (e.g. dispersal, reproduction, area/edge sensitivity) and landscape (e.g. fragmentation, matrix quality, rate of change). With enough empirical support, such trends could be useful for making important predictions about species' responses to habitat loss, to guide future research on the underlying causes of critical thresholds, and to make better informed management decisions. Some have seen critical thresholds as a means of identifying conservation targets for habitat retention. We argue that in many cases this may be misguided, and that the meaning (and utility) of a critical threshold must be interpreted carefully and in relation to the response variable and management goal. Despite recent interest in critical threshold responses to habitat loss, most studies have not used any formal statistical methods to identify their presence or value. Methods that have been used include model comparisons using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or t-tests, and significance testing for changes in slope or for polynomial effects. The judicious use of statistics to help determine the shape of ecological relationships would permit greater objectivity and more comparability among studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The existence of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone makes it clear that marine ecosystems can be damaged by terrestrial inputs. Marine and terrestrial conservation planning need to be aligned in an explicit fashion to fully represent threats to marine systems. To integrate conservation planning for terrestrial and marine systems, we used a novel threats assessment that included 5 cross-system threats in a site-prioritization exercise for the Pacific Northwest coast ecoregion (U.S.A.). Cross-system threats are actions or features in one ecological realm that have effects on species in another realm. We considered bulkheads and other forms of shoreline hardening threats to terrestrial systems and roads, logging, agriculture, and urban areas threats to marine systems. We used 2 proxies of freshwater influence on marine environments, validated against a mechanistic model and field observations, to propagate land-based threats into marine sites. We evaluated the influence of cross-system threats on conservation priorities by comparing MARXAN outputs for 3 scenarios that identified terrestrial and marine priorities simultaneously: (1) no threats, (2) single-system threats, and (3) single- and cross-system threats. Including cross-system threats changed the threat landscape dramatically. As a result the best plan that included only single-system threats identified 323 sites (161,500 ha) at risk from cross-system threats. Including these threats changed the location of best sites. By comparing the best and sum solutions of the single- and cross-system scenarios, we identified areas ideal for preservation or restoration through integrated management. Our findings lend quantitative support to the call for explicitly integrated decision making and management action in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {For marine benthic invertebrates exhibiting complex life cycles, changes in populations' distribution and abundance are governed by a large variety of physical, chemical and biological processes. From field observations in the Bay of Seine and laboratory experiments conducted since 1987 on the polychaete Pectinaria koreni, the present study highlights the relative importance of hydrodynamical and biological factors which affect individuals within both the planktonic and benthic phases at different scales of space and time in a macrotidal area. Pectinaria koreni is one of the main macrofaunal component of the Abra alba muddy fine sand community of the eastern Bay of Seine. Despite a highly advective and diffusive environment, a relative larval retention near adult population was reported due to some local hydrodynamics features (e.g. tidal residual circulation, Seine river plume front) and the interaction between the vertical current structure and the larval vertical migration. Although larval retention could be disrupted by wind induced currents, multiple spawning events over the reproductive period increase the likelihood that at least one larval cohort ensures a high recruitment during the life-span. Following a massive settlement whatever the sediment grain size, the newly settled larvae exhibited a high immediate decrease of their densities as a result of postlarval mortality and migration. Postlarval drifting was induced by a combination of physical factors (i.e. tidal currents and swell) and postlarval behaviour in response to sediment texture and adult/settlers interactions. According to the hydrodynamics of the bay, this process may generate a postlarval transport from offshore bottoms to coastal suitable habitats and counteract the demographic effects of larval dispersal. A conceptual model of factors governing the recruitment and population maintenance of Pectinaria koreni is proposed and discussed in comparison with results obtained on another polychaete, Owenia fusiformis, in the same area.},

The importance of doing a power analysis before beginning a study (prospective power analysis) is universally accepted: such analyses help us to decide how many samples are required to have a good chance of getting unambiguous results. In contrast, the role of power analysis after the data are collected and analyzed (retrospective power analysis) is controversial, as is evidenced by the papers of Reed and Blaustein (1995) and Hayes and Steidl (1997). The controversy is over the use of information from the sample data in retrospective power calculations. As I will show, the type of information used has fundamental implications for the value of such analyses. I compare the approaches to calculating retrospective power, noting the strengths and weaknesses of each, and make general recommendations as to how and when retrospective power analyses should be conducted.}

However, the potential ramifications to the ecological function of seafloor communities and ecosystems have yet to be considered. Soft-sediment organisms create much of their habitat's structu re and also have crucial roles in many population, community, and ecosystem processes. Many of these roles are filled by species that are sensitive to h abitat disturbance. Functional extinction refers to the situation in which species become so rare that they do not fulfill the ecosystem roles that have evolved in the system. This loss to the ecosystem occurs when there are restrictions in the size, density, and distribution of organisms that threaten t he biodiversity, resilience, or provision of ecosystem services. Once the functionally important components of an ecosystem are missing, it is extremely difficult to identify and understand ecological thresholds. The extent and intensity of human disturbance to oceanic ecosystems is a significant threat to both structural and functional biodiversity and in many cases this has virtually eliminated natural systems that might serve as baselines to evaluate these impacts.},

This study details a novel strategy that enabled us to rapidly collect data on macrofaunal densities and sediment characteristics by sampling mud-to-sand transition zones in 19 estuaries. Species-specific models that predict probability of occurrence relative to sediment mud content were developed for 13 common macrofaunal species. However, the roles played by many macrofaunal species are influenced by density, not just occurrence. Over broad spatial scales, the constraint an environmental variable places on density can be represented by the upper (or lower) limit on density. Thus, the distribution of maximum density along the gradient from mud to sand was modelled as another indicator of a species¹ preference. Both the maximum and minimum values for number of taxa, number of individuals, Shannon-Wiener diversity and taxonomic distinctness were also modelled. For most variables, good models (r2 > 0.6) were developed. The models developed for the different species exhibited a wide variety of functional forms, highlighting the potential variation in response to habitat change even for closely related species with similar natural history characteristics. Probability-of-occurrence models and maximum-density models for a specific species also varied in functional form, emphasising that changes in both occurrence and density need to be considered when predicting likely responses to changes in habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {I investigated demography and foraging behavior of the southern sea otter (Enyhdra lutris nereis), in order to examine the individual and population-level consequences of alternative foraging strategies, and to evaluate the importance of food-limitation as a factor limiting population growth. I developed a maximum likelihood-based analytical method to estimate historical age/sex-specific vital rates, and spatial/temporal variation in vital rates, using carcass age-structure and population census databases. To estimate current demographic trends I conducted a mark-recapture study, measuring survival and reproduction of 115 radio-tagged study animals between 2001 and 2004. Together, these analyses indicate that survival has decreased substantially between the early 1990s and the present, and is lowest in the north-central portion of the sea otter’s range. The greatest decrease was for adult (> 4 years of age) females: variation in survival of this age/sex class is primarily responsible for regulating population growth and driving population trends. I also collected foraging data from 60 marked sea otters, and found pronounced individual dietary specialization (greater than that reported previously). Cluster analysis indicated that individual diets could be grouped into three general “diet types”; differences in foraging behavior between these diet types suggest that they represent distinct foraging strategies. The rate of energy gain while foraging was low for the population as a whole, but showed a high degree of variation. Foraging strategies differed with respect to mean energy gain; however, because the mean and within-animal variation in rate of energy gain were positively correlated, all three strategies result in similar probabilities of exceeding a critical rate of energy gain on any given day, and there is likely a trade-off between the mean and variance in the rate of energy gain. Correlational selection is also important in maintaining multiple foraging strategies within the population: a multivariate fitness surface fit to foraging behavior indicates multiple fitness peaks corresponding to alternative foraging strategies.

  abstract  = {Dietary diversity often varies inversely with prey resource abundance. This pattern, although typically measured at the population level, is usually assumed to also characterize the behavior of individual animals within the population. However, the pattern might also be produced by changes in the degree of variation among individuals. Here we report on dietary and associated behavioral changes that occurred with the experimental translocation of sea otters from a food-poor to a food-rich environment. Although the diets of all individuals were broadly similar in the food-rich environment, a behaviorally based dietary polymorphism existed in the food-poor environment. Higher dietary diversity under low resource abundance was largely driven by greater variation among individuals. We further show that the dietary polymorphism in the food-poor environment included a broad suite of correlated behavioral variables and that the individuals that comprised specific behavioral clusters benefited from improved foraging efficiency on their individually preferred prey. Our findings add to the growing list of examples of extreme individuality in behavior and prey choice within populations and suggest that this phenomenon can emerge as a behavioral manifestation of increased population density. Individuality in foraging behavior adds complexity to both the fitness consequences of prey selection and food web dynamics, and it may figure prominently as a diversifying process over evolutionary timescales.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to forecasting population growth, basic demographic data combined with movement data provide a means for predicting rates of range expansion. Quantitative models of range expansion have rarely been applied to large vertebrates, although such tools could be useful for restoration and management of many threatened but recovering populations. Using the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) as a case study, we utilized integro-difference equations in combination with a stage-structured projection matrix that incorporated spatial variation in dispersal and demography to make forecasts of population recovery and range recolonization. In addition to these basic predictions, we emphasize how to make these modeling predictions useful in a management context through the inclusion of parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Our models resulted in hind-cast (1989–2003) predictions of net population growth and range expansion that closely matched observed patterns. We next made projections of future range expansion and population growth, incorporating uncertainty in all model parameters, and explored the sensitivity of model predictions to variation in spatially explicit survival and dispersal rates. The predicted rate of
southward range expansion (median ¼ 5.2 km/yr) was sensitive to both dispersal and survival rates; elasticity analysis indicated that changes in adult survival would have the greatest potential effect on the rate of range expansion, while perturbation analysis showed that variation in subadult dispersal contributed most to variance in model predictions. Variation in survival and dispersal of females at the south end of the range contributed most of the variance in predicted southward range expansion. Our approach provides guidance for the acquisition of further data and a means of forecasting the consequence of specific management actions. Similar methods could aid in the management of other recovering populations.},

  abstract  = {Reliable information on historical and current population dynamics is central to understanding patterns of growth and decline in animal populations. We developed a maximum likelihood-based analysis to estimate spatial and temporal trends in age/sex-specific survival rates for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), using annual population censuses and the age structure of salvaged carcass collections. We evaluated a wide range of possible spatial and temporal effects and used model averaging to incorporate model uncertainty into the resulting estimates of key vital rates and their variances. We compared these results to current demographic parameters estimated in a telemetry-based study conducted between 2001 and 2004. These results show that survival has decreased substantially from the early 1990s to the present and is generally lowest in the north-central portion of the population's range. The greatest temporal decrease in survival was for adult females, and variation in the survival of this age/sex class is primarily responsible for regulating population growth and driving population trends. Our results can be used to focus future research on southern sea otters by highlighting the life history stages and mortality factors most relevant to conservation. More broadly, we have illustrated how the powerful and relatively straightforward tools of information-theoretic-based model fitting can be used to sort through and parameterize quite complex demographic modeling frameworks.},

  abstract  = {Global patterns of species richness and their structuring forces have fascinated biologists since Darwin and provide critical context for contemporary studies in ecology, evolution and conservation. Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales. Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa, our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms. Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is an endangered seabird that nests in coastal forests from Alaska to California. The value of these forests for human use, coupled with the difficulty of determining whether a forest stand is occupied by nesting marbled murrelets, poses a dilemma for land managers. Should they implement a costly survey to gather information on whether a potential nest site is occupied, or should they allow human use, effectively assuming the site is unoccupied? This article demonstrates the application of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) as a framework for addressing this question. The analysis yields a policy in which the optimal action is a function of the decision-maker’s subjective probability that a potential nest site is occupied by marbled murrelets. By incorporating stochastic state dynamics and the choice of whether to invest in learning, the POMDP provides a formal representation of adaptive management when active learning is possible.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Metrics have become a standard way for summarizing environmental monitoring results. Different metrics react differently to natural variations and human-induced stressors. We suggest that combined analysis of time trends in selected biological metrics allows identification of biological processes (e.g. individual growth, mortality or recruitment) that have changed (increased or decreased) persistently. Alternatively, time trends in the abundance of sensitive species could indicate changes in environmental stressors. 
2. We calculate the joint likelihood of time trends in three metrics and use it to evaluate the evidence in the data for different combinations of metric time trends. A simulation study provides guidelines for interpreting log-likelihood differences. 
3. We illustrate the approach for identifying biological process changes for three North Sea fish stocks (cod Gadus morhua, lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and whiting Merlangius merlangius) using metrics derived from international bottom-trawl survey data for the period 1997--2008. Over the period, a decrease in recruitment and several simultaneous process changes were most likely for cod, while a recruitment increase, mortality decrease and several process changes were most likely for lesser-spotted dogfish. No significant persistent process changes were found for whiting. 
4. Synthesis and applications. The likelihood approach offers a way of combining monotonic time trends in multiple metrics for identifying persistent changes in exploited populations or environmental stressors, given suitable metric time series and tables for interpreting joint time trends. For data rich fish populations, the proposed method can supplement analytical stock assessments. For many other populations with no fisheries-dependent data, it offers a way to identify population changes, which will be crucial for implementing the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the European marine strategy framework directive.},

This analysis shows that the most common types of individual quota programs can induce discarding, and that individual quota programs that regulate the value of harvests never induce discarding. Since discarded fish have a high mortality rate, ‘‘value-based’’ individual quota programs are superior to their more conventional counterparts in that they waste fewer fish. The disadvantages of value-based quotas are also examined. Results are driven by the fact that the harvest technology examined here does not satisfy a ‘‘free-disposal’’ assumption. Since this free-disposal assumption is ubiquitous in production theory, and not obviously true, the framework developed herein may be useful for analyzing a broad class of problems involving joint production},

  Abstract                 = {The wider effects of fishing on marine ecosystems have become the focus of growing concern among scientists, fisheries managers and the fi shing industry. The present review examines the role of habitat structure and habitat heterogeneity in marine ecosystems, and the effects of fishing ( i.e. trawling and dredging) on these two components of habitat complexity. Three examples from New Zealand and Australia are considered, where availab le evidence suggests that fishing has been associated with the degradation or loss of habitat structure through the removal of large epibenthic organi sms, with concomitant effects on fish species which occupy these habitats. With ever-increasing demands on fish-stocks and the need for sustainable us e of fisheries resources, new approaches to fisheries management are needed. Fisheries management needs to address the sustainability of fish-stocks w hile minimizing the direct and indirect impacts of fishing on other components of the ecosystem. Two long-term management tools for mitigating degrada tion or loss of habitat structure while maintaining healthy sustainable fisheries which are increasingly considered by fisheries scientists and manage rs are: (1) protective habitat management, which involves the designation of protected marine and coastal areas which are afforded some level of prote ction from fishing; and (2) habitat restoration, whereby important habitat and ecological functions are restored following the loss of habitat and/or resources. Nevertheless, the protection of marine and coastal areas, and habitat restoration should not be seen as solutions replacing conventiona l management approaches, but need to be components of an integrated programme of coastal zone and fisheries management. A number of recent internation al fisheries agreements have specifically identified the need to provide for habitat protection and restoration to ensure long-term sustainability of fisheries. The protection and restoration of habitat are also common components of fisheries management programs under national fisheries law and policy.},

OCs were detected in livers of all of the skipjack tuna collected from the locations surveyed, supporting the thesis that there is widespread contamination of persistent OCs in the marine environment. Within a location, no significant relationship between growth-stage (body length and weight) and OC concentrations (lipid weight basis) was observed, and the OC residue levels were rather uniform among the individuals. Interestingly, the distribution of OC concentrations in skipjack tuna was similar to those in surface seawaters from which they were taken. These results suggest that OC concentrations in skipjack tuna could reflect the pollution levels in seawater from which they are collected and that this species is a suitable bioindicator for monitoring the global distribution of OCs in offshore waters and the open ocean. Concentrations of PCBs and CHLs in skipjack tuna were higher in offshore waters around Japan (up to 1100 and 250 ng/g lipid wt, respectively), suggesting the presence of sources of PCBs and CHLs in Japan. High concentrations of DDTs and HCHs were observed in samples from the Japan Sea, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and the Bay of Bengal (up to 1300 and 22 ng/g lipid wt, respectively). This result suggests recent use of technical DDT and HCH for agricultural and/or public health purposes in Russia, China, India, and some other developing Asian countries. Relatively high concentrations of PCBs, CHLs, HCHs, and HCB were also observed in samples collected from some locations in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, indicating the expansion of OC contamination on a global scale. Considering these facts, continuous studies monitoring these compounds in offshore waters and the open seas, using skipjack tuna as a bioindicator, are needed to further understand the future trend of contamination.},

The report describes some of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems; some fishing practices that, in specific circumstances, may be harmful; as well as the types of damage that may be caused, either directly or indirectly, by certain fishing practices. It should be read in conjunction with earlier reports on related issues, in particular, reports of the Secretary-General on oceans and the law of the sea A/58/65, A/59/62 and A/60/63/Add.1, as well as recent fisheries reports A/60/189 and A/CONF.210/2006/1. Pursuant to the above-mentioned General Assembly resolutions, the report outlines actions taken by States either by themselves or through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements (RFMOs) to address destructive fishing practices that may have adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems, as well as such actions taken by RFMOs. The report also describes actions taken by some RFMOs to expand their competence, and recent initiatives by States to establish new RFMOs where none exist.},

  abstract  = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

  abstract  = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

  abstract  = {Metapopulation theory is one of the most popular approaches to identify the factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations in fragmented habitat networks. Habitat quality, patch area and isolation are mainly focused on when analyzing distribution patterns in fragmented landscapes. The effects of landscape heterogeneity in the non-occupied matrix, however, have been largely neglected. Here, we determined the relative importance of patch quality and landscape attributes on the occurrence, density and extinction of the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti), an endangered steppe passerine whose habitat has been extremely reduced to highly isolated and fragmented patches embedded in a mainly unsuitable landscape matrix. Habitat patch quality, measured in terms of vegetation structure, grazing pressure, arthropod availability, predator abundance, and inter-specific competition, did not affect occurrence, density or extinction. At the landscape scale, however, the species' occurrence was principally determined by the interactions among patch size, geographic isolation and landscape matrix. Isolation had the main independent contribution to explaining the probability of occurrence, followed by landscape matrix composition and patch size. The species' density was negatively correlated to patch size, suggesting crowding effects in small fragments, while extinction events were exclusively related to isolation. Our findings suggest that landscape rather than local population characteristics are crucial in determining the patterns of distribution and abundance of non-equilibrium populations in highly fragmented habitat networks. Consequently, conservation measures for these species should simultaneously involve patch size, isolation and landscape matrix and apply to the entire metapopulation rather than to particular patches.},

A random forest (RF) modelling approach was used to examine how changing per-angler harvest or minimum size limit regulations affected sport fishery harvest in US Atlantic coast recreational fisheries. Harvest limits per angler (i.e. bag limits) were typically high initially and subsequently reduced, whereas almost half of minimum length limits were initially below the length-at-maturity and subsequently increased. Across most fisheries examined, extreme reductions in harvest limits (e.g. from unlimited to catch-and-release) were largely ineffective at limiting total fishery harvest. Increasingly restrictive minimum length limits caused a greater average harvest reduction than per-angler harvest limits. Some regulation changes were associated with higher angling effort and thus increased harvest, which suggests that when effort cannot be constrained, more direct harvest limitations should be considered.},

Part I explores how SARA has notionally placed science and law at the helm in the quest to protect endangered and threatened species. COSEWIC, a committee with scientific expertise, has been established to assess the status of wildlife species. SARA provides nine major legal levers for protecting listed species, including general prohibitions against harming species or damaging their residences. Part II highlights the sea of uncertainties being faced in implementation practice. Uncertainties include: contested listing criteria; politically dependent listing decisions; hazy general prohibitions; leeway for incidental harm permitting; recovery strategy and action plan fogginess; critical habitat issues; unsettled relationships with other federal laws; and methodological tensions in how risks should be managed. Part III seeks to chart a course for future legislative and institutional reforms. Besides amendments to SARA, the paper advocates the urgent need to move from “deathbed treatment” to proactive encouragement of biodiversity health through such initiatives as fully implementing Canada’s Oceans Act, establishing a network of marine protected areas, and modernizing Canada’s antiquated Fisheries Act.},

  Abstract                 = {A formal economic analysis of the discarding problem is presented, focusing on the individual fisherman and the effect of different regulations on the fisherman’s incentives to discard. It is shown that in a nonregulated fishery, either multispecies or single species/multisize, where the only constraints are the hold capacity and the length of the season, the fisherman may have rational incentives to discard/highgrade, if the marginal trip profit of an extra fishing day is greater than the average trip profit. Regulation by TAC does not change the incentives to discard. However, under INTQs and ITQs, the incentives to discard increase. The incentives to discard decrease under ITQs compared to INTQs, if the unit quota price is smaller than the shadow price of the quota. The model is applied to the Greenland shrimp fishery, where it demonstrates the reported discard behavior in the fishery. Finally, different regulations of discard are applied and discussed in the model. The analysis suggests that regulation of fishing days could be a promising alternative to usual suggested measures like tax/subsidies and landings obligations.},

  Abstract                 = {Conservation actions frequently need to be scheduled because both funding and implementation capacity are limited. Two approaches to scheduling are possible. Maximizing gain (MaxGain) which attempts to maximize representation with protected areas, or minimizing loss (MinLoss) which attempts to minimize total loss both inside and outside protected areas. Conservation planners also choose between setting priorities based solely on biodiversity pattern and considering surrogates for biodiversity processes such as connectivity. We address both biodiversity processes and habitat loss in a scheduling framework by comparing four different prioritization strategies defined by MaxGain and MinLoss applied to biodiversity patterns and processes to solve the dynamic area selection problem with variable area cost. We compared each strategy by estimating predicted species' occurrences within a landscape after 20 years of incremental reservation and loss of habitat. By incorporating species-specific responses to fragmentation, we found that you could improve the performance of conservation strategies. MinLoss was the best approach for conserving both biodiversity pattern and process. However, due to the spatial autocorrelation of habitat loss, reserves selected with this approach tended to become more isolated through time; losing up to 40% of occurrences of edge-sensitive species. Additionally, because of the positive correlation between threats and land cost, reserve networks designed with this approach contained smaller and fewer reserves compared with networks designed with a MaxGain approach. We suggest a possible way to account for the negative effect of fragmentation by considering both local and neighbourhood vulnerability to habitat loss.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A simulation method was developed for identifying populations with levels of human-caused mortality that could lead to depletion, taking into account the uncertainty of available information. A mortality limit (termed the Potential Biological Removal, PBR, under the U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act) was calculated as the product of a minimum population estimate (NMIN), one-half of the maximum net productivity rate (RMAX), and a recovery factor (FR). Mortality limits were evaluated based on whether at least 95% of the simulated populations met two criteria: (1) that populations starting at the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) stayed there or above after 20 yr, and (2) that populations starting at 30% of carrying-capacity (K) recovered to at least MNPL after 100 yr. Simulations of populations that experienced mortality equal to the PBR indicated that using approximately the 20th percentile (the lower 60% log-normal confidence limit) of the abundance estimate for NMIN met the criteria for both cetaceans (assuming RMAX= 0.04) and pinnipeds (assuming RMAX= 0.12). Additional simulations that included plausible levels of bias in the available information indicated that using a value of 0.5 for FR would meet both criteria during these trials. It is concluded that any marine mammal population with an estimate of human-caused mortality that is greater than its PBR has a level of mortality that could lead to the depletion of the population. The simulation methods were also used to show how mortality limits could be calculated to meet conservation goals other than the U. S. goal of maintaining populations above MNPL.},

  Abstract                 = {Species patchiness implies that nearby observations of species abundance tend to be similar or that individual conspecific organisms are more closely spaced than by random chance. This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species–environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms. We end by identifying conceptual and statistical challenges that need to be addressed for adequate spatial analysis of landscapes.},

Samples of L. pertusa exhibited seasonal reproduction, whereas the evidence for M. oculata is equivocal but suggests multiple cohorts of gamete production. L. pertusa produces a single cohort of around 3,000 oocytes, whereas M. oculata produces two cohorts, with a total fecundity of around 60 oocytes. The maximum observed oocyte size in L. pertusa was 140um and in M. oculata was 405um. From these oocyte sizes and the timing of reproduction, a lecithotrophic larva is expected, though not observed. This seasonality of reproduction fits with the phytodetrital food fall occurring around July in the Seabight area. L. pertusa was found to be non-reproductive at the Darwin Mound site. Though unable to be specifically tested, this may suggest that the increased trawling activity in this area might be keeping colonies below sexually viable sizes, as seen in numerous shallow water situations. All areas in the NE Atlantic are coming under threat from increased fishing and commercial exploration practices. This study shows that these highly seasonal reproducers could be sensitive to these fishing operations and care must be taken so as not to repeat the destruction that has occurred on shallower reefs.},

  Abstract                 = {Blue marlin, Makaira nigricans, catch (number per set) in the Hawaii-based longline fishery from March 1994 through June 2002 was analyzed by integrated use of observer reports, commercial logbooks, and auction sales records. The objective was to provide a corrected catch history for this species in this fishery during this period. The study was conducted because official statistics compiled from the logbooks are known to be biased by billfish (Istiophoridae) misidentifications. The initial step entailed fitting a generalized additive model (GAM) of blue marlin catch to environmental and operational data gathered by fishery observers during 8397 longline sets deployed by commercial vessels. The GAM included nine significant predictors and explained 41.1% of the deviance of observed blue marlin catches. The GAM coefficients were then applied to the corresponding predictors in the logbook reports from unobserved sets to estimate catches in evaluations of the accuracy of data from unobserved sets (N = 87 277 longline sets on 8437 trips; 95.4% of unobserved effort). This was done by regressing the logbook catch data on the predictions, using the residuals to identify trips with systematic misidentifications, and then checking their logbooks against sales records from the public fish auction in Honolulu. The large majority of the misidentifications consisted of striped marlin, Tetrapturus audax, reported as blue marlin, with lesser numbers of shortbill spearfish, T. angustirostris, logged as blue marlin, and blue marlin logged as either striped marlin or black marlin, M. indica. An estimate obtained by use of the GAM and observer data indicated that the nominal catch of blue marlin was inflated by 29.4%. The 95% prediction limits about the GAM-generated estimate (34 201-41 507 blue marlin) did not include the catch total from the logbooks (48 911 blue marlin). The corrections also refined understanding of the distribution of blue marlin by reducing the impression that large numbers of blue marlin are sometimes caught north of Hawaii in the autumn and early winter months. There was no evidence of widespread underreporting of marlins. We conclude that this study significantly improved the accuracy of logbook data for blue marlin and should also contribute to improved understanding of the ecology and distribution of blue marlin. We infer that self-reporting could yield accurate marlins catch data if species identifications were improved because there was no apparent underreporting problem. Finally, we recommend that logbook data accuracy receive serious attention in the context of stock assessments.},

  Abstract                 = {A generalized additive model (GAM) of blue shark, Prionace glauca, catch rates (catch per set) was fitted to data gathered by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) observers stationed aboard Hawaii-based commercial longline vessels (N=2010 longline sets) from March 1994 to December 1997. Its coefficients were then applied to the values of predictor variables, which were also contained in logbook records that described the remainder of fishery-wide effort during the study period (N=41 319 longline sets). The objective was to determine whether predictions generated by such a GAM could serve in lieu of observers on the large fraction of longline trips that do not carry an observer (approximately 95%). After deleting data considered false or inaccurate, much of which was associated with a small number of vessels, the relationship between catch rates as reported in logbooks and GAM predictions was expressed by loge(Y+1)=0.7952 loge(X+1)-0.0586where Y is the catch rate (i.e., the number of blue shark caught per set) and X the GAM predictions (R2=0.307, N=40 243). Patterns of correspondence between logbook trends and GAM predictions were further refined by plotting the trends according to the type of fishing effort (e.g., tuna- or swordfish-directed). The highest mean catch rates reported in logbooks, the highest mean GAM predictions, and the greatest differences between the two occurred consistently in mid-year on swordfish trips. In contrast, mean values from logbooks and mean GAM predictions were closest for tuna-directed effort, but this reflected an order of magnitude reduction in the scale of catch rates rather than closely similar trends. A bootstrapping algorithm developed for the GAM yielded an estimate of 23.9% under-reporting for the study period, with approximate 95% prediction limits of 15.4-28.9%. We conclude that prediction with a GAM fitted to fishery observer data is a useful monitoring technique for the Hawaii-based commercial longline fishery. It allowed us: to gain insight into fleet-wide and individual logbook reporting practices, to estimate the relationship between logbook data and predicted values, to characterize bias in this relationship, and to identify patterns specific to each major sector of the fishery.},

  Abstract                 = {A multispecies spatial model is proposed for evaluation of trawl management strategies and tested with data from British Columbia groundfish. Minimum stock sizes are estimated for 16 species using spatial catch per unit effort data; these data indicate that only small proportions of most stocks are exposed to fishing at any time and that exchange rates of fish between the grounds and other habitats are rapid. A gravity model for spatial effort allocation predicts substantial side effects of marine protected areas or discarding of particular species on nontarget species/grounds due to redistribution of fishing effort. Multispecies, multiground delay-difference models are used in conjunction with the gravity model for spatial effort distribution to predict long-term population responses to various regulatory strategies. This simulation suggests that species composition and spatial structure of the fishery are changing slowly due to reduction in abundance of long-lived species, but rapid collapses of target stocks are unlikely due to spatial redistribution of effort in response to local declines. We question whether quota management (individual vessel quotas) can be safely implemented due to extreme uncertainty about current stock sizes and suggest that a better strategy may be to simply denominate fishing rights as individual effort quotas while providing protection for sensitive stocks through carefully placed marine protected areas.},

Natural areas bordered by urban communities have restricted size and constrained management options that confound goals of preserving biodiversity. Using geographical information systems and observational and experimental studies, we determined that current microsites required for seedling establishment within existing habitat of the federally endangered Crenulate leadplant are few and spatially restricted, resulting in little wild seedling recruitment. Experimental and wild seedlings had highest germination rates in litter layers 1â€“2 cm in depth and survived the longest in litter 0.5â€“2 cm deep. Fire suppression and aggressive native and exotic plants have accumulated litter up to 33 cm near some of the wild adult Crenulate leadplant. Only 9% of habitat occupied by this taxon at its largest population is conducive to seedling establishment. Similarly, 30% is conducive to seedling establishment in the second largest population. Fire plays a critical role in South Florida ecosystem dynamics and the restoration and preservation of its landscape and biodiversity. When fire is not possible, other management is needed. Manual litter and downed debris removal are recommended at both population sites to improve the probability of Crenulate leadplant seedling establishment and population persistence.},

  Abstract                 = {Because studies of environmental accidents must be initiated after the fact and because the accidents cannot (or should not) be replicated, sampling cannot be entirely randomized, and investigations involve some degree of confounding and pseudoreplication. The study designs that can be used carry methodological limitations and ecological assumptions, which must be considered in evaluating results. The methodological issues relate to consistency in sampling methods and to the adequacy of sampling of levels of environmental disturbance or contamination, while the ecological assumptions derive from spatial and temporal variation in biological resources and the factors that affect them. We assess how these methodological issues and ecological assumptions affect study designs based on before–after comparisons and on single-time or multiple-time sampling after an accident. Designs that rest on the assumption of a steady-state equilibrium in resource-environment relationships (baseline and time-series designs) must be interpreted with particular care, and baseline designs are sensitive to the effects of pseudoreplication and inconsistencies in methods. Other designs (pre/post paired samples, impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) assume only that environmental variations are equivalent among areas and/or contamination levels (a dynamic equilibrium) and are less affected by pseudoreplication. Single-time designs (comparisons between impact and reference sites, between matched paired sites, or over a contamination gradient) have fewer methodological limitations, but assume that other natural factors that may influence the response of a resource are equal among all samples. If measurements of other factors are included in the design, covariance analysis may help to reduce this problem. In evaluating the effects of unplanned environmental impacts, post facto study designs that document both initial effects and subsequent recovery (impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) or that treat effects as continuous rather than categorical variables (gradient or trend designs) may be more useful than before–after comparisons.},

  Abstract                 = {Chronic marine oil pollution is an ongoing global problem, yet no model currently exists to assess seabird mortality from continuous low-level inputs of oil. Taking into account persistence and detection rates of birds on beaches, and the wind-dependent proportion of birds lost at sea, we present a general mathematical Oiled Seabird Mortality Model (OSMM) to assess seabird mortality due to chronic oil pollution along a given coastline, using birds counted during systematic beached-bird surveys. We applied our OSMM to Newfoundland, Canada, where the incidence of chronic oil pollution is among the highest in world. We estimated that between 1998 and 2000, an average of 315,000 Â± 65,000 murres (common [Uria aalge] and thick-billed [U. lomvia]) and dovekies (Alle alle) were killed annually in southeastern Newfoundland due to illegal discharges of oil from ships. Thick-billed murres that overwinter on the Grand Banks made up 67% of this kill. This species already is subject to extensive summer and winter hunting in Greenland, as well as winter hunting in Newfoundland, which harvests an additional 250,000-300,000 birds/year. Although populations remain stable, these levels of sustained mortality make thickbilled murre populations vulnerable to pulse perturbations and ocean regime shifts and hamper our ability to set harvest at sustainable levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Habitat conservation plans (HCPs) allow incidental take of threatened or endangered species in exchange for conservation measures that minimize and mitigate such taking. Habitat conservation plans entail a compromise between regulatory certainty and scientific uncertainty. This compromise is controversial because many HCPs are thought to inadequately address scientific uncertainty. Adaptive management is the systematic acquisition and application of reliable information to improve natural resource management over time. Ideally, under adaptive management, conservation strategies are implemented as a deliberate experiment. This approach can establish cause-and-effect relationships and point the way toward optimal strategies. Adaptive management has been promoted as essential to management under uncertainty, but few HCPs incorporate genuine adaptive management. Habitat conservation plans will continue to lack adaptive management until certain conditions are met, such as acknowledgment that an HCP is a management hypothesis, landowner interest in improving biological outcomes, and sufficient financial resources. Economic incentives would encourage adaptive management in HCPs. Habitat conservation plan permittees might receive direct payments or tax deductions for reliable information that benefits a species. Mitigation credits could be awarded for information produced through adaptive management. In effect, habitat would be exchanged for information that benefits a species. Successful use of mitigation credits would depend on correctly valuing information and enforcement of the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Under a precautionary polluter pays principle, an HCP permittee would put up an environmental assurance bond. Portions of the bond are returned with interest as adaptive management demonstrates that environmental damages are unlikely to occur. Funds spent on adaptive management are funds unavailable for habitat protection, so limited financial resources may force a compromise between protecting habitat and acquiring knowledge.},

  abstract  = {A variety of decision models have been formulated for the optimal selection of nature reserve sites to represent a diversity of species or other conservation features. Unfortunately, many of these models tend to select scattered sites and do not take into account important spatial attributes such as reserve shape and connectivity. These attributes are likely to affect not only the persistence of species but also the general ecological functioning of reserves and the ability to effectively manage them. In response, researchers have begun formulating reserve design models that improve spatial coherence by controlling spatial attributes. We review the spatial attributes that are thought to be important in reserve design and also review reserve design models that incorporate one or more of these attributes. Spatial modeling issues, computational issues, and the trade-offs among competing optimization objectives are discussed. Directions for future research are identified. Ultimately, an argument is made for the development of models that capture the dynamic interdependencies among sites and species populations and thus incorporate the reasons why spatial attributes are important.},

  Abstract                 = {Protected areas are often proposed as tools for conserving endangered populations of marine megafauna. Our study area includes a voluntary no-entry reserve embedded within wider critical habitat for Threatened [`]northern resident' killer whales under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Our study quantified the reserve's importance to whales by assessing habitat preference in a behavioural context, and population-level implications of that preference given threats from human activities, such as oil spills resulting from shipping traffic. We recorded summertime activities of whales from 1995 to 2002. Whales were observed on 397 of 530 (74.9%) days. Whales showed strong preference for the reserve over adjacent waters, and used it preferentially for feeding and beach-rubbing. While the area comprises ~0.001% of the whales' range, an overall average of 6.5% of the population was present each day. Frequently, >50% of this small population was aggregated in the restricted and heavily trafficked waterway of Johnstone Strait. Using the Potential Biological Removal equation, we calculated potential annual mortality limits (ML) of 2.2 animals. Mean group size in the area exceeded ML on 55.8% of days overall, and 98.8% of days when conditioning on whale presence. The whales' high reliance on a trivial fraction of their range means that opportunities are routine for one stochastic, catastrophic event to cause population decline. On 20 August 2007, a barge loaded with ~10,000 L of diesel sank in the area, exposing 25% of the population. This underscores the importance of identifying critical habitat for threatened populations, and ensuring meaningful protection.},

  Abstract                 = {A generic framework for setting conservation priorities based on the principles of classic decision theory is provided. This framework encapsulates the key elements of any problem, including the objective, the constraints, and knowledge of the system. Within the context of this framework the broad array of approaches for setting conservation priorities are reviewed. While some approaches prioritize assets or locations for conservation investment, it is concluded here that prioritization is incomplete without consideration of the conservation actions required to conserve the assets at particular locations. The challenges associated with prioritizing investments through time in the face of threats (and also spatially and temporally heterogeneous costs) can be aided by proper problem definition. Using the authorsâ€™ general framework for setting conservation priorities, multiple criteria can be rationally integrated and where, how, and when to invest conservation resources can be scheduled. Trade-offs are unavoidable in priority setting when there are multiple considerations, and budgets are almost always finite. The authors discuss how trade-offs, risks, uncertainty, feedbacks, and learning can be explicitly evaluated within their generic framework for setting conservation priorities. Finally, they suggest ways that current priority-setting approaches may be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most pressing issues facing the global conservation community is how to distribute limited resources between regions identified as priorities for biodiversity conservation. Approaches such as biodiversity hotspots, endemic bird areas and ecoregions are used by international organizations to prioritize conservation efforts globally. Although identifying priority regions is an important first step in solving this problem, it does not indicate how limited resources should be allocated between regions.Here we formulate how to allocate optimally conservation resources between regions identified as priorities for conservation—the ‘conservation resource allocation problem’. Stochastic dynamic programming is used to find the optimal schedule of resource allocation for small problems but is intractable for large problems owing to the “curse of dimensionality”.We identify two easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret heuristics that closely approximate the optimal solution. We also show the importance of both correctly formulating the problem and using information on how investment returns change through time. Our conservation resource allocation approach can be applied at any spatial scale. We demonstrate the approach with an example of optimal resource allocation among five priority regions in Wallacea and Sundaland, the transition zone between Asia and Australasia.},

We develop such a framework, and apply it to 17 of the world’s 39 Mediterranean ecoregions. This framework offers an improvement over approaches that only focus on land purchase or species richness and do not account for threats. We discover that one could protect many more plant and vertebrate species by investing in a sequence of conservation actions targeted towards specific threats, such as invasive species control, land acquisition, and off-reserve management, than by relying solely on acquiring land for protected areas. Applying this new framework will ensure investment in actions that provide the most cost-effective outcomes for biodiversity conservation. This will help to minimise the misallocation of scarce conservation resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Conservation planning is the process of locating and designing conservation areas to promote the persistence of biodiversity in situ. To do this, conservation areas must be able to mitigate at least some of the proximate threats to biodiversity. Information on threatening processes and the relative vulnerability of areas and natural features to these processes is therefore crucial for effective conservation planning. However, measuring and incorporating vulnerability into conservation planning have been problematic. We develop a conceptual framework of the role of vulnerability assessments in conservation planning and propose a definition of vulnerability that incorporates three dimensions: exposure, intensity, and impact. We review and categorize methods for assessing the vulnerability of areas and the features they contain and identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of each broad approach. Our review highlights the need for further development and evaluation of approaches to assess vulnerability and for comparisons of their relative effectiveness.},

We question this assumption using a local modelling technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR), not previously used in fisheries analyses. Outputs of GWR are compared with those of global logistic regression and generalized additive models (GAMs) in predicting the distribution of northern cod off Newfoundland, Canada, based on environmental (temperature and distance from shore) and biological factors (snow crab and northern shrimp) from 2001. Results from the GWR models explained significantly more variability than the global logistic and GAM regressions, as shown by goodness-of-fit tests and a reduction in the spatial autocorrelation of model residuals. GWR results revealed spatial regions in the relationships between cod and explanatory variables and that the significance and direction of these relationships varied locally. A k-means cluster analysis based on GWR t-values was used to delineate distinct zones of species-environment relationships. The advantages and limitations of GWR are discussed in terms of potential application to fisheries ecology.},

  abstract  = {Spatial autocorrelation in wildlife observation data arises when extrinsic environmental processes and patterns that influence the spatial distribution of wildlife are themselves spatially structured, or when species are subject to intrinsic population processes, causing contagion or dispersion effects. Territoriality, Allee effects, dispersal limitations, and social clustering are examples of intrinsic processes. Both forms of autocorrelation can violate the assumptions of generalized linear regression models, resulting in biased estimation of model coefficients and diminished predictive performance. Such consequences may be avoided for extrinsic autocorrelation when autocorrelated environmental variables are available for use as model covariates, whereas intrinsic spatial autocorrelation requires an alternative modeling approach. The autologistic model provides an approach suited to the binary observations often obtained in wildlife surveys, but its performance has not been tested across widely varying sampling intensities or strengths of intrinsic spatial structure. Here we use simulated data to test the autologistic model under a range of sampling conditions. The autologistic model obtains better fits and substantially better predictive performance than the standard logistic regression model over the full range of sampling designs and intensities tested. We provide a simple Bayesian implementation of the autologistic model, which until now has not been achieved with standard statistical software alone. A step-by-step procedure is given for characterizing and modeling spatial autocorrelation in binary observation data, along with computer code for fitting autologistic models in WinBUGS, a freeware Bayesian analysis package. This approach avoids normal approximations to the pseudo-likelihood, in contrast to previous Bayesian applications of the autologistic model. We provide a sample application of the autologistic model, fitted to survey data for a gliding marsupial in southeastern Australia.},

In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources.},

Silverman's kernel density method was found to be very conservative. The excess mass test and a Bayesian mixture model approach showed agreement among the data sets, whereas Hall and York's test provided strong evidence for the existence of two or more modes in all data sets. The Bayesian mixture model also provided a way to quantify the uncertainty associated with the number of modes. This work demonstrates the inherent richness of animal body mass distributions but also the diffculties for characterizing it, and ultimately understanding the processes underlying them.},

  abstract  = {Accurate efficient estimation of actual and potential species distribution is a critical requirement for effective ecosystem-based management and marine protected area design. In this study we tested the applicability of a terrestrial landscape modeling technique in a marine environment for predicting the distribution of ecologically and economically important groundfish, using 3 species of rockfish at Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) as a model system. Autoclassification of multibeam bathymetry along with georeferenced submersible video transect data of the seafloor and demersal fishes were used to model the abundance and distribution of rockfish. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were created using habitat classification analyses of high-resolution (3 m) digital elevation models combined with fish presence/absence observations. Model accuracy was assessed using a reserved subset of the observation data. The resulting probability of occurrence models generated at 3 m resolution for the entire 120 km2 study area proved reliable in predicting the distribution of all the species. The accuracies of the models for Sebastes rosaceus, S. flavidus and S. elongatus> were 96, 92 and 92%, respectively. The probability of occurrence of S. flavidus and S. rosaceus was highest in the high relief rocky areas and lowest in the low relief, soft sediment areas. The model for S. elongatus had an opposite pattern, with the highest predicted probability of occurrence taking place in the low relief, soft sediment areas and a lower probability of occurrence in the rocky areas. These results indicate that site-specific and species-specific algorithmic habitat classification applied to high-resolution bathymetry data can be used to accurately extrapolate the results from in situ video surveys of demersal fishes across broad areas of habitat.},

  abstract  = {We quantified the distribution, abundance, biomass and assemblage structure of benthic macrofauna at different spatio-temporal scales in a temperate estuarine, intertidal soft-sediment environment in the Schelde estuary, The Netherlands. Hierarchically scaled surveys were conducted yearly between 1994 and 2000, covering 4 spatial scales: region (104 m), transect (103 m), station (102 m), and replicate samples (10-1 m). Our approach provided a powerful framework for quantifying the proportion of the variation among samples that was attributable to each spatial or temporal scale, and we explicitly aimed at identifying the role of environmental variables in explaining the observed variability. Variance components calculated for 11 dominant macrobenthic species revealed that variations at the scale of stations and year × station interactions were the most important components of variability. Regional and transect differences were only apparent for a few species, although multivariate analysis revealed clear inter-regional differences for the macrobenthic assemblage structure. Only a few species displayed significant variability associated with the factor year solely. Both spatial and temporal components explained >70% of the total variance. A substantial part of the total variation in abundance of individual species was explained by the observed environmental variables (27 to 56%). Multiple regression with subdivision of the environmental variables into a long-term average and a temporal component showed that the long-term averages were much more important than the short-term deviations from this average, with local environmental variables (mud content, chlorophyll a, bed level height) explaining the largest part of the observed variation. For a few species and total biomass, salinity also explained a large part of the observed variation. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection revealed that salinity and mud content, and to a lesser extent chlorophyll a and bed-level height, accounted for most of the variance in the macrobenthic species data. Partial CCA indicated that of the variation in the species data a large part was spatially structured (56.7%), with about half of this variation being explained by the environmental variables used. Only 4.1% of the species variation was temporally structured. Our results have important consequences for both the interpretation of monitoring programmes and the enhancement of sampling designs.},

  abstract  = {Pond farming for sea cucumber has developed rapidly along the northern coast of China in the recent years. Holothurians inhabiting ponds undergo seasonal fluctuations of salinity. This study deals with the bioenergetic responses of pond-cultured sea cucumbers Apostichopus japonicus (wet weight of 37.5 ± 1.8 g) to different water salinities [22, 27, 31.5, and 36 practical salinity units (psu)] at 15 °C in the laboratory to determine the influence of water salinity on growth and energy allocation in this species. Results show that ingested energy and scope for growth (SFG) were highest at 31.5 psu and then decreased when water salinity was below or above this point. Although energy ingested was lowest at 36 psu, the lowest SFG occurred at 22 psu (only 102.68 ± 14.26 J/g/d) because animals reared at 22 psu spent much more consumed energy on feces (72.19%), respiration (21.70%), and excretion (2.59%), leaving less energy for growth (3.52%). Results suggest that pond-cultured sea cucumbers could tolerate chronic salinity fluctuations at a range of 22 to 36 psu and grew better between 27 and 31.5 psu, but decreased at salinities above and below the mentioned salinity range.},

  Abstract                 = {Marine environments have suffered from a lack of quantitative methods for delineating areas that are sensitive or vulnerable to particular stresses, natural and anthropogenic. We define sensitivity as the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range. Vulnerability can then be defined as the probability that a feature will be exposed to a stress to which it is sensitive. Using these definitions, we provide a quantitative methodology for identifying vulnerable marine areas based on valued ecological features, defined as biological or physical features, processes, or structures deemed by humans to have environmental, social, cultural, or economic significance. The vulnerability of the valued ecological features is a function of their sensitivity to particular stresses and their vulnerability to those stresses. We used the methodology to demonstrate how vulnerable marine areas for two groups of endangered whale species (inshore and offshore) could be identified with a predictive habitat model and acoustic stress surfaces. Acoustic stress surfaces were produced for ferry traffic, commercial shipping traffic, potential offshore oil production, and small-boat traffic. The vulnerabilities of the two whale groups to the four stressors considered in this example were relatively similar; however, inshore species were more sensitive to on-shelf, coastal activities such as offshore hydrocarbon production, ferry traffic, and small-boat traffic. Our approach demonstrates how valued features can be associated with stresses and the likelihood of encountering these stresses (vulnerability) in order to identify geographic areas for management and conservation purposes. The method can be applied to any combination of valued ecological features and stressors.},

Coordinated efforts in all three areas are needed to make progress in understanding soft-sediment systems, which arguably comprise the largest set of landscapes on the earth.

The density of sea cucumbers counted in transects averaged 20.8 individuals·ha-1 in the inner, 70.9 in the middle, and 103.7 in the outer stratum of the cove. Six types of substrata were encountered: mud/sand, debris, rock, shell, rock wall, and algae. Sea cucumbers were found at almost all depths from the intertidal zone to as deep as 183 m. Higher densities were encountered in 2 distinct depth zones: above 60 m and between 100 m and 150 m. This bimodal distributional pattern was attributed to the depth distribution of the rock wall substrate, which supported the highest density of sea cucumbers at 234·ha-1. The higher densities of sea cucumbers along the nearly vertical rock walls are unexplained; rock walls may be preferred to the unstable nature of other substrates on the steeply sloped wall of the cove, or they may be selected for spawning.},

  Abstract                 = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the 6-S selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a balanced exploitation approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},

Gosset aka 'Student' who was for most of his life Head Experimental Brewer at Guinness, took an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty.

  abstract    = {Protected areas remain the fundamental building blocks of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, supported by governments and international institutions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity. They provide the core of efforts to protect the world’s threatened species and are increasingly recognised as essential providers of ecosystem services and biological resources; key components in climate change mitigation strategies; and in some cases also vehicles for protecting threatened human communities or sites of great cultural and spiritual value. Covering almost 12 percent of the world’s land surface, the global protected area system represents a unique commitment to the future; a beacon of hope in what sometimes seems to be a depressing slide into environmental and social decline.
Protected areas are by no means uniform entities however; they have a wide range of management aims and are governed by many different stakeholders. At one extreme a few sites are so important and so fragile that no-one is allowed inside, whereas other protected areas encompass traditional, inhabited landscapes and seascapes where human actions have shaped cultural landscapes with high biodiversity. Some sites are owned and managed by governments, others by private individuals, companies, communities and faith groups. We are coming to realize that there is a far wider variety of governance than we had hitherto assumed.
The IUCN protected area management categories are a global framework, recognised by the Convention on Biological Diversity, for categorizing the variety of protected area management types. Squeezing the almost infinite array of approaches into six categories can never be more than an approximation. But the depth of interest and the passion of the debate surrounding the revision of these categories show that for many conservationists, and others, they represent a critical overarching framework that helps to shape the management and the priorities of protected areas around the world.
We have not rushed this revision. It began with a two-year consultative research project that reported to the World Conservation Congress in Bangkok in 2004, resulting in a resolution calling for the production of the guidelines presented in this book. In the years since, IUCN has consulted with a huge number of its
members in special meetings, conferences, electronic debates and through what sometimes seemed like an endless correspondence. We are well aware that the results are not perfect – an impossible task. But we believe the interpretation of the protected area definition and categories presented here represents the opinion of the large majority of IUCN members. Importantly, they are complemented by the IUCN governance types, demonstrating the importance that the Union is giving to issues of governance.
In the years to come we will be working to promote the category system, to translate the guidelines into more languages and to make sure they are applied effectively, in order to maximize the potential of the global protected area system in perpetuity.},

This attribute has enabled biologists to document spawning distributions for more than 70 years throughout the 29 500 km coastline of western Canada. Spawning distributions and spatial diversity have varied over time. When aggregated over 70 years (1938--2007), spawning occurred along 5574 km or ~20% of the total coastline. Cumulative annual spawn length ranges from 131 (in 1966) to 770 km (in 1992). We examined annual changes in spawn distribution using spatial units of variable size, ranging in area from a maximum of >1000 km2 to a minimum of <0.1 km2. Assessment of spatial diversity varied with the size of the spatial unit. Spatial diversity estimated from small spatial units (area <0.1 km2) was significantly correlated with spawning-stock biomass (SSB). In contrast, there was no correlation, and sometimes opposite temporal trends, between SSB and all larger spatial units (mean area >0.3 km2). The choice of spatial scale can affect the results from analyses of other factors, such as SSB, that could affect spatial diversity of spawning areas.},

In the present study, dynamics of stock abundance and biomass of these species were reconstructed using Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis. The cod stock declined from an historic high during the early 1980s to its lowest level on record at the beginning of the 1990s, showing no sign of recovery afterwards. The sprat stock size increased to a historic high level concurrently, while herring abundance was slightly reduced. However, a substantial reduction in herring weight at age resulted in a continuous decline of the total biomass from the early 1980s. A review of recruitment processes influenced by the variable physical environment was performed for cod and sprat, i.e. the species most intensively studied and showing the largest variability in stock sizes. The most important processes are (i) egg production in dependence of ambient hydrographic conditions and food availability, (ii) egg developmental success in relation to oxygen concentration and temperature at depths of incubation, (iii) egg predation by clupeids dependent on predator-prey overlap, (iv) larval development in relation to hydrographic processes and food availability, and (v) predation on juveniles. All the above processes negatively affected the cod population, while the sprat stock benefited from them, despite a developing industrial fishery, resulting in a regime shift from a cod to a sprat dominated system in the Central Baltic.},

  abstract  = {Single and multispecies models are used to examine the effect of species interaction on biological reference points for cod, herring, and sprat in the Baltic. The results demonstrate that reference points are different in single and multispecies contexts. Reference points for fishing mortality based on single-species yield and SSB calculations are difficult to use when natural mortality depends on the absolute abundance of the predators and their alternative prey. Reference points based on maximizing total yield from the system may lead to impractical results when species interact. Multispecies predictions suggest that the cod stock in the Baltic should be reduced to a very low level of biomass in order to benefit from the higher productivity of herring and sprat, its major prey. Such a result stresses the need for incorporating socio-economic considerations in the definition of target reference points. Management advice based on biomass reference points will also differ. In the single species situation the combinations of cod and pelagic fishing effort for which the equilibrium spawning-stock biomass of the three species is above the biomass reference points forms a rectangular area. When biological interaction is taken into account the limits of this area becomes curved. Reference limits for forage fish cannot be defined without considering changes in the biomass of their natural predators. Likewise, reference limits for predators cannot be defined without considering changes in the biomass of their prey.},

  abstract     = {Biological reference points (BRPs) are widely used to define safe levels of harvesting for marine fish populations. Most BRPs are either minimum acceptable biomass levels or maximum fishing mortality rates. The values of BRPs are determined from historical abundance data and the life-history parameters of the fish species. However, when the life-history parameters change over time, the BRPs become moving targets. In particular, the natural mortality rate of prey species depends on predator levels; conversely, predator growth rates depend on prey availability. We tested a suite of BRPs for their robustness to observed changes in natural mortality and growth rates. We used the relatively simple Baltic Sea fish community for this sensitivity test, with cod as predator and sprat and herring as prey. In general, the BRPs were much more sensitive to the changes in natural mortality rates than to growth variation. For a prey species like sprat, fishing mortality reference levels should be conditioned on the level of predation mortality. For a predator species, a conservative level of fishing mortality can be identified that will prevent growth overfishing and ensure stock replacement. These first-order multispecies interactions should be considered when defining BRPs for medium-term (5–10 year) management decisions.},

  abstract     = {At two points in the past (1970 and 1995), North Sea herring (Clupea harengus) abundance and catches have been in a similar situation: the stock had declined from an earlier high and reached a depleted state with a spawning-stock biomass of around 400 000 t, well below the agreed biomass limit reference point of 800 000 t. Catches were also similar at 600 000 t annually, and too high to be sustainable. A comparison of the scientific advice, the management actions, and their effects on population trends over the periods following these two critical years provides insight into important management issues. The benefits to the industry of the value of the cumulative catch resulting from successful management of this large stock have been proven to outweigh by far the costs of obtaining good management advice. The conclusion is that sound scientific information plays an important role when difficult management issues have to be confronted. However, there are other critical issues, such as the stakeholders' wish to preserve the stock at all costs and a management organization that has authority to take decisions.},

Here, we propose a set of intuitive harvest control rules that are economically sound, compliant with international fishery agreements, based on relevant international experiences, supportive of ecosystem-based fisheries management and compatible with the biology of the fish stocks. The rules are based on the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), with a precautionary target biomass that is 30% larger than that which produces MSY and with annual catches of 91%MSY. Allowable catches decline steeply when stocks fall below MSY levels and are set to zero when stocks fall below half of MSY levels. We show that the proposed rules could have prevented the collapse of the North Sea herring in the 1970s and that they can deal with strong cyclic variations in recruitment such as known for blue whiting. Compared to the current system, these rules would lead to higher long-term catches from larger stocks at lower cost and with less adverse environmental impact.},

  abstract  = {In 1977, Peter Larkin published his now-famous paper, "An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield". Larkin criticized the concept of single-species maximum sustained yield (MSY) for many reasons, including the possibility that it may not guard against recruitment failure, and the impossibility of maximising sustainable yields for all species simultaneously. However, in recent years, there has been a fundamental change in the perception of the fishing mortality associated with MSY (FMSY) as a limit to be avoided rather than a target that can routinely be exceeded. The concept of FMSY as a limit is embodied in several United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) agreements and guidelines, and has now been incorporated into the US Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. As a result, the United States now requires the development of overfishing definitions based on biological reference points that treat the FMSY as a limit reference point and must also define a lower limit on biomass below which rebuilding plans with strict time horizons must be developed. This represents a major paradigm shift from the previously mandated (but often unachieved) objective to simply maintain fishing mortalities at levels below those associated with recruitment overfishing. In many cases, it requires substantial reductions in current fishing mortality levels. Therefore, the necessity of the new paradigm is continually questioned. This paper draws on examples from several fisheries, but specifically focuses on the recent US experience illustrating the practical difficulties of reducing fishing mortality to levels below those corresponding to MSY. However, several studies suggest that even more substantial reductions in fishing mortality may be necessary if ecosystem considerations, such as multispecies interactions, maintenance of biodiversity and genetic diversity, and reduction of bycatch and waste, are taken into account. The pros and cons of moving beyond single-species assessment and management are discussed. A US plan for improving stock assessments indicates that even a "basic" objective such as "adequate baseline monitoring of all managed species" may be extremely costly. Thus, the suggestion of Larkin (1983, 1997) that the costs of research and management should not exceed 10--20% of the landed value of the catch may preclude comprehensive ecosystem management. More importantly, neither single-species nor ecosystem-based fisheries management is likely to improve appreciably unless levels of fishing capacity are aligned with resource productivity, as is currently being promoted by FAO and several individual nations.},

These tools are based on particular choices for the underlying population dynamics model, the aspects of the assessment considered uncertain, and the approach for assessing uncertainty (Bayes, frequentist or likelihood). The current state of the art is advancing rapidly as a consequence of the availability of increased computational power, but there remains little consistency in the choices made for assessments and forecasts. This can be explained by several factors including the specifics of the species under consideration, the purpose for which the analysis is conducted and the institutional framework within which the methods are developed and used, including the availability and customary usage of software tools. Little testing of either the methods or their assumptions has yet been done. Thus, it is not possible to argue either that the methods perform well or perform poorly or that any particular conditioning choices are more appropriate in general terms than others. Despite much recent progress, fisheries science has yet to identify a means for identifying appropriate conditioning choices such that the probability distributions which are calculated for management purposes do adequately represent the probabilities of eventual real outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that increased focus should be placed on testing and carefully examining the choices made when conducting these analyses, and that more attention must be given to examining the sensitivity to alternative assumptions and model structures. Provision of advice concerning uncertainty in stock assessments should include consideration of such sensitivities, and should use model-averaging methods, decision tables or management procedure simulations in cases where advice is strongly sensitive to model assumptions.},

Most plans began within the last two decades, so quantifying progress is difficult, but some 60 cases were found where a recovery effort had been explicitly tackled by either a closure or restrictive measures, and seven documented case studies were used to draw general conclusions onrecovery procedures and to provide a list of considerations for best practice in recovery planning. More successes were documented for pelagic .sheries than demersals, especially with closures, while spontaneous recoveries of some depleted invertebrate resources seem related to reductions in predator pressure. Few shared, straddling or highly migratory stocks have been restored to date. Most successful recoveries occurredin the centre of the species geographical range and/or in favourable regimes. Success seems to depend on non-discretionary fishery control laws being applied. Depletions aggravated by unfavourable climatic regimes will be difficult to reverse, as illustrated by a simulation. Durations of recovery plans in particular depend on regime, and using stock information from favourable regimes to predict plan duration should be treated with caution. Although successful recoveries to date have tended to be decadal, a considerable proportion are still underway, and are likely to exceed this duration.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a simulation study that evaluated the performance of the scientific advisory process used by ICES to recommend total allowable catches (TACs) for roundfish stocks. A "management strategy evaluation" approach is used, involving development of an operating model to represent the underlying reality, and an observation model to generate pseudo data that are then used within a management procedure. The management procedure comprises an assessment that uses data to estimate parameters of interest and a decision rule to derive TAC recommendations for the following year. There are two important results: including realistic sources and levels of uncertainty can result in far from optimal management outcomes based on the current procedures; and current ICES biomass and fishing mortality reference points are not always consistent, and several are clearly inappropriate. This is because the types of projection used by ICES do not incorporate important lags between assessing stock status and implementing management measures, and they also ignore important sources of uncertainty about the actual dynamics, as well as our ability to collect data and implement management regulations (i.e. model, measurement, and implementation error, respectively). The simulation approach also showed that better management is not necessarily going to be achieved by improving the assessment, because even with a perfect assessment (where the simulated working group knew stock status perfectly), stocks may crash at fishing levels that standard stochastic projections would suggest were safe. It is proposed that, in future, operating models that represent the best available understanding of the actual system dynamics be used to evaluate models and rules considered for application. These operating models should capture the plausible range of characteristics of the underlying dynamics, but not necessarily model their full complexity. In general, they will be more complex than those used by assessment working groups, so developing management procedures that are robust to a broad range of uncertainty. However, the models and rules used as part of the management procedure should be simpler than those used at present.},

  abstract  = {We present a framework for evaluating the cause of fishery declines by integrating covariates into a fisheries stock assessment model. This allows the evaluation of fisheries' effects vs. natural and other human impacts. The analyses presented are based on integrating ecological science and statistics and form the basis for environmental decision-making advice. Hypothesis tests are described to rank hypotheses and determine the size of a multiple covariate model. We extend recent developments in integrated analysis and use novel methods to produce effect size estimates that are relevant to policy makers and include estimates of uncertainty. Results can be directly applied to evaluate trade-offs among alternative management decisions. The methods and results are also broadly applicable outside fisheries stock assessment. We show that multiple factors influence populations and that analysis of factors in isolation can be misleading. We illustrate the framework by applying it to Pacific herring of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). The Pacific herring stock that spawns in Prince William Sound is a stock that has collapsed, but there are several competing or alternative hypotheses to account for the initial collapse and subsequent lack of recovery. Factors failing the initial screening tests for statistical significance included indicators of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, coho salmon predation, sea lion predation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and effects of containment in the herring egg-on-kelp pound fishery. The overall results indicate that the most statistically significant factors related to the lack of recovery of the herring stock involve competition or predation by juvenile hatchery pink salmon on herring juveniles. Secondary factors identified in the analysis were poor nutrition in the winter, ocean (Gulf of Alaska) temperature in the winter, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the pathogen Ichthyophonus hoferi. The implication of this result to fisheries management in Prince William Sound is that it may well be difficult to simultaneously increase the production of pink salmon and maintain a viable Pacific herring fishery. The impact can be extended to other commercially important fisheries, and a whole ecosystem approach may be needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of salmon hatcheries.},

  abstract  = {The long-term management of a stock representing a metapopulation has been simulated in a case study loosely based upon herring to the west of the British isles, where stocks are currently assessed and managed by management area, although there is evidence of mixing between stocks (in terms of connectivity, migrations, and exploitation). The simulations evaluate scientific advice (based on virtual population analysis, VPA) and the sustainability of fishing under two population-structure scenarios, corresponding either to discrete stocks, which only mix on the feeding grounds, or where diffusion between stocks takes place. The ability of stock assessment to monitor stock status and exploitation levels was evaluated for defining stocks based on fishing areas and for stocks that combined fishing areas. The study showed that assessment based on VPA of the metapopulation could fail to detect overexploitation of stocks and fail to detect and distinguish between the effects of exploitation and regime shifts.},

  abstract  = {Herring caught in the Thames Estuary sustain a small local commercial fishery (peak catch of 606 t during the 1972â€“1973 fishing season). Loss of local consumers' interest in the herring product has resulted in a gradual decline in catches and fishing effort for the stock. The stock is assessed using an age-structured model that relies on the information provided by a scientific trawl survey, and management advice is provided before the fishing season starts in October. Given its current low economic value, managers have requested evaluation of options for multi-annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) in an attempt to reduce the frequency (and costs) of assessment and associated management advice. A tentative relationship between sea surface temperature and recruitment is used to predict the impact of increasing sea temperatures on future recruitment in the context of global warming. Hypotheses of auto-correlation and of an environmental effect on recruitment, together with trends in weight-at-age and the overestimation of spawning-stock biomass, form the basis for sensitivity tests of the management options considered. Implementation of a 3-year fixed TAC with 40% constraint in TAC variability and a slight reduction in target F would seem appropriate for the stock, given that it is within safe biological limits and compares well in terms of yield and risk with the current approach of annual TAC revision.},

  abstract  = {Growth rates of herring in the northern Baltic Sea differ among areas, and have changed substantially over time in some areas in response to environmental change. Weight-at-age of adult herring in some areas of the Finnish herring fishery fluctuated by as much as 60% over the past three decades. Elsewhere, there have been similar but more subtle changes. Growth variation has implications for stock assessment and management: differences suggest a need for considering a smaller spatial structure, at least at the scale of the ICES subdivision, in the case of northern Baltic herring. Changes in growth have an impact on the calculation and use of common biological reference points, and erode the capability of yield projections beyond the short term. Investigation of the impact of growth variation on common reference points of northern Baltic herring revealed that F0.1 was a robust reference despite the marked variability in growth, whereas Fx%SPR (e.g. F35%SPR) was less robust, depending on the definition of maximum spawning-per-recruit. Herring in different areas of the northern Baltic Sea probably require different reference points and possibly different management strategies, as a consequence of differences and variability in growth characteristics.},

  abstract  = {Correct catch data are necessary for age-structured assessment models. Those data may be biased among other reasons due to fishing practices such as discarding or selection by gear and subsequent escapee mortality. In a number of fisheries juveniles make a large fraction of catches while their survival is low. We applied length-specific selection and escapee mortality functions to estimate “underwater discarding” and the actual total removals from the herring (Clupea harengus L.) stock in the northern Baltic Sea. Contemporarily an array of fleet selection scenarios was investigated to estimate the impact of underwater discarding on perceived stock dynamics. The analysis showed that in ages 0 and 1 year herring are discarded underwater in larger numbers than landed. Unaccounted mortality involves a marked seasonal pattern because the growth rate of immature herring is high. During the first quarter of the year the first fully recruited age group is 1 year instead of 2 years as indicated by catch samples. The effect of fishing induced mortality decreases as a function of age and size so that the impact on estimated recruitment and fishing mortality at age 1 year is considerable, but irrelevant at age 2 years and older. The actual fishing mortality at age 1 year is estimated to be more than twice higher than estimates of F based on the unadjusted data. The practical effect of underwater discarding on evaluation of stock status, the stock–recruitment function, and reference points is minor. However, changes in codend mesh size, induced by management actions or fishing strategies, should be recognized and their effects considered in stock assessment, in short term forecasts, and in management advice.},

For herring, MSVPA produced greater abundance estimates than single-species assessments, especially for the youngest age classes. The average rate of predation mortality for herring aged 0 and 1 was also higher than the standard total natural mortality rate (0.2) for the 21-year time frame (0.84-3.2). The same was true for mackerel in this MSVPA (0.37--1.6). Consumptive removals of herring and mackerel generally increased over time. From 1999 to 2001, the biomass removed by predators exceeded each species' commercial landings. The sum of consumption and landings notably exceeded the multispecies maximum sustainable yield for herring for the years 1995â€“2002 and for mackerel for the period 1999â€“2002. We highlight the importance of accounting for predation on forage species in the context of changes to the fish community that have taken place in the Northwest Atlantic over the past few decades.},

  abstract     = {Mortality of small pelagic fish due to marine mammals is generally considered to be low compared with other sources of mortality. With recent recoveries of marine mammal predators worldwide, this may no longer hold. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Bothnian Sea has increased fivefold since 1985. Its main prey, herring (Clupea harrengus), is a key species for fisheries in the region. Yet, current stock assessments assume constant natural mortality, leading to a risk of biased stock estimates with increasing predation and misleading analyses of herring population dynamics. We estimated grey seal predation from diet data and reanalysed herring spawning stock biomass (SSB) during 1973--2009. Accounting for predation increased the herring SSB 16% (maximum 19%), but this was within the confidence intervals when ignoring predation. Although mortality in older individuals was inflated when accounting for seal predation, this did not change the conclusions about drivers of herring dynamics. Accounting for grey seal predation is important for abundance estimates of old herring, but currently not for SSB estimates, given the great uncertainties in the standard assessment. The grey seal impact on Bothnian Sea herring will need to be reassessed if stock age composition, grey seal feeding preferences, or total stock development change.},

Here we demonstrate that biological reference points generated by explicitly incorporating predation mortality into population dynamic models are generally more conservative (e.g., recommend higher standing biomass) than those produced using traditional assessment methods. Because biological reference points are the benchmark against which fisheries management decisions are made, they should reflect the ecological realities faced by each species to the fullest extent possible. We suggest much broader consideration of the more conservative biological reference points produced by explicitly incorporating predation mortality as a component of natural mortality to population models. This approach could implement a powerful yet tractable facet of ecosystem based fisheries management and is especially important for those stocks where predation mortality is known or suspected to be important.},

Following a moratorium on fishing the stock, a small fishery of about 10 000 t started in 1975. From analyses of several harvesting strategies it was decided to recommend fishing at or near F0.1. When the fishery was reopened it was managed by individual non-transferable quotas per boat that gradually developed into an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system. The development, the implementation, and the effect of the harvesting strategy and the management system are discussed and evaluated. Results indicate that a strategy of catching 20% of the adult stock biomass (3-ringers and older) would be useful from the point of view of achieving an optimal sustainable harvest from the stock without risking stock depletion. This is not markedly different from the current exploitation strategy, which has now been very successful for almost a quarter of a century.},

  abstract = {Forage fish play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about $16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was $5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable ($11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes.},

Objectives and harvest control rules in the management of the fishery of Norwegian spring-spawning herring. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1793–1799.The main element in the management of the Norwegian spring-spawning herring, as implemented by the coastal states, is to conduct the fishery based on a maximum fishing mortality (F) of 0.125. As the appropriateness of this rule (given the stated objectives) has not yet been tested thoroughly, we set out to do this by long-term simulations, in which we applied a range of alternative stock–recruitment relationships. These different relationships are estimated from historical replicates of the stock, as calculated by the herring-stock assessment model SeaStar. During prognostic simulations, a recruitment model is selected probabilistically for each historical replicate based on Akaike weights. We evaluate whether the management objectives are met by applying the present harvest control rule. Results are given for the current assessment option of natural mortality (M = 0.5) in the oldest aggregated age group and for the assessment option used in 2005 and earlier (M = 0.15). These show that perceptions of the long-term yield differ considerably and that the current management is somewhat on the conservative side from the perspective of maximum sustainable yield.},

  abstract     = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

Marine forage fishes, such as sardines, anchovies, and herring, are a nexus for such trade-offs because they are both central nodes in marine food webs and targeted by fisheries. An important example is Pacific herring, Clupea pallisii in the Northeast Pacific. Herring populations are subject to two distinct fisheries: one that harvests adults and one that harvests spawned eggs. We develop stochastic, age-structured models to assess the interaction between fisheries, herring populations, and the persistence of predators reliant on herring populations.Weshow that egg- and adult-fishing have asymmetric effects on herring population dynamics - herring stocks can withstand higher levels of egg harvest before becoming depleted. Second, ecosystem thresholds proposed to ensure the persistence of herring predators do not necessarily pose more stringent constraints on fisheries than conventional, fishery driven harvest guidelines. Our approach provides a general template to evaluate ecosystem trade-offs between stage-specific harvest practices in relation to environmental variability, the risk of fishery closures, and the risk of exceeding ecosystem thresholds intended to ensure conservation goals are met.},

Five sources of information are discussed in this research document: historical stock status advice; the presence or absence of spawning components; the fate of individual year classes (cohorts) over time (mortality rate trends and proportion of juvenile fish); historical landings; and acoustic survey relative index.
With the evidence of the decline in spawning grounds, targeting of juveniles in the fishery, declines in catches, as well as the science advice indicating the need for rebuilding, it is proposed that the 2005 to 2010 average acoustic survey value be identified as the conservation limit reference point for Southwest Nova Scotia / Bay of Fundy herring (German Bank and Scots Bay). The stability at the 2005-2010 level is support for this as the limit reference point and provides data from which to select a point, below which, the risk of serious harm is unacceptable. Other considerations that lead to the selection of this point relate to the objective of avoiding negative impacts to the ecosystem and long-term loss of fishing opportunities. Ecosystem considerations include herring's role as a forage fish, and long-term loss of fishing opportunities in the case of stock collapse and possible decades required for recovery to occur.},

  abstract    = {Herring stock abundance in British Columbia (B.C.) waters are assessed for 2010 and forecasts were made for 2011 using the herring catch-age model (HCAMv2), developed for the 2008 assessment (and revised in 2009).  B.C. herring stocks are managed as five major and two minor stock areas. Accordingly, catch and survey information is collected independently for each of these seven areas and science advice is provided on the same scale.  All available biological data on spawn deposition and age and size composition of the spawning stocks, as well as commercial harvest data, were used to determine current abundance levels.  Herring abundance has remained relatively stable over the past few years, with no substantial changes in 2010.  The total estimated pre-fishery biomass for the major assessment regions for 2010 is 84,656 metric tonnes (t), broken down as follows: Haida Gwaii (QCI 2E) – 6,046 t, Prince Rupert District (PRD) – 19,039 t, Central Coast (CC) – 7,974 t, Strait of Georgia (SOG) – 48,262 t, and west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) – 3,335 t .  Pre-fishery biomass estimates for 2009 and 2008 are 103,470 t and 95,076 t, respectively.  Recruitment of the 2007 year class in 2010 was poor for HG, CC, SOG and WCVI, while recruitment in PRD was average.  Pre-fishery biomass for the minor stock areas for 2010 and recruitment of the 2007 year class in 2010 were estimated as 7,593 t with good recruitment for Area 2W and 998 t with poor recruitment for Area 27.

Stock projections for 2011 indicate reduced abundance and poor recruitment in three major stock areas.  Implementation of the herring harvest control rule (HCR) advises the following stocks will not support a commercial harvest: HG, WCVI, and CC.  Spawning stock biomass for two of the five major stock areas is forecast to be above the biomass cutoff level for 2011.  Based on a 20% harvest rate and application of the recruitment forecasting rules, the estimated maximum available harvest of B.C. herring for 2011 is 3,834 t for the PRD stock (assuming average recruitment) and 13,777 t for the SOG (assuming good recruitment).  The HCR for the minor stock areas assumes average recruitment, in developing the stock biomass forecast, and recommends a 10% harvest rate.  Following application of these rules, the recommended maximum available harvest for the minor stocks in 2011 is: 253 t in Area 2W (based on the 2010 spawn index) and 94 t in Area 27.},

  abstract    = {This is the fifth edition of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Pacific herring stock status report. Unlike previous editions, the scope of this report is limited to Puget Sound due to a lack of assessment of coastal herring stocks since the last stock status report published in 2009. Localized, documented herring spawning grounds in Washington waters are used to represent individual spawning stocks, and spawning biomass and other characteristics are reported at this scale. However, genetic studies to date have indicated that most Puget Sound herring stocks are not distinct from each other, or British Columbia herring stocks; the exceptions being the Cherry
Point and Squaxin Pass stocks. These studies indicate that it may be more meaningful to examine abundance trends of Puget Sound herring on a larger scale than the individual spawning stock level presented in this report. An evaluation of Puget Sound herring biomass trends at various geographic aggregation levels is presented on page 63 of this report.
Individual stock status classifications since the 2009 status report have exhibited a decrease in the percentage classified as healthy or moderately healthy (Table E1) while cumulative abundance of all stocks, excluding Cherry Point stock, remained relatively stable (Figure E1) over the years. This report contains the first spawning abundance data for the newly identified Elliot Bay herring stock, which was first documented in April of 2012 by WDFW staff.
For the 2011-12 period the aggregate Puget Sound herring stock, excluding the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks, is considered moderately healthy. The overall abundance of south and central Puget Sound herring stocks since the previous stock status report has decreased, although the cumulative south/central stocks (excluding Squaxin Pass) are still classified as moderately healthy. Within this region, the Quilcene Bay and Holmes Harbor herring stocks are currently at high levels of abundance and have comprised an increasing portion of the south/central Puget Sound region’s spawning biomass. The Cherry Point stock shows no signs of recovery from its critically low level of abundance. The cumulative north Puget Sound (excluding the Cherry Point stock) regional spawning biomass is classified as moderately healthy; the Strait of Juan de Fuca regional spawning biomass continues to be at a low level of abundance (critical status); and the Squaxin Pass stock is assessed as moderately healthy at this time.},

We investigate in this paper algorithms to automatically repair a single polygon. Automated repair algorithms can be considered as interpreting ambiguous or ill-defined polygons and returning a coherent and clearly defined output (the definition of the international standards in our case). We present a novel approach, based on the use of a constrained triangulation, to automatically repair invalid polygons. Our approach is conceptually simple and easy to implement as it is mostly based on labelling triangles. It is also flexible: it permits us to implement different repair paradigms (we describe two in the paper). We have implemented our algorithms, and we report on experiments made with large real-world polygons that are often used by practitioners in different disciplines. We show that our approach is faster and more scalable than alternative tools.},

  abstract    = {Foragers with narrow dietary niches often exhibit specialized hunting behaviours that improve their efficiency for capturing preferred prey, but can leave them vulnerable if the abundance of this prey declines. I examined the specificity of foraging behaviour by a highly selective predator, the northern resident killer whale (Orcinus orca), which specializes on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Northern residents are undoubtedly well adapted to capture Chinook, however, their hunting tactics have never been described due to the challenges of quantifying underwater behaviour. To address this research gap, I deployed archival tags (DTAGs) on 32 killer whales to measure their acoustic and kinematic behaviour during foraging dives. Reconstructed 3-dimensional tag tracks indicated that foraging and non-foraging dives were kinematically distinct. While engaged in hunting behaviour, whales dove deeper, remained submerged longer, swam faster, increased their dive path tortuosity, and rolled their bodies more than during other activities. Maximum foraging dive depths reflected both the deeper vertical distribution of Chinook (compared to other salmonids), as well as the tendency of these fish to evade predation by diving steeply. Inferences from whale movements further revealed that salmon engaged in other anti-predation strategies, including increasing swim speeds and evasive manoeuvring. DTAG records also provided the first definitive link between echolocation and prey captures by resident killer whales, who displayed significantly higher clicking rates and spent proportionally more time echolocating prior to capturing a fish than they did afterward. Rapid ‘buzz’ click sequences were often produced before fish captures, which is consistent with their hypothesized function of close-range prey targeting. Furthermore, prey handling ‘crunches’ were usually detected following kills and, with buzzes, provide possible acoustic proxies for capture attempts and successes that could be used to estimate foraging efficiency. My thesis determined that northern resident killer whales possess specialized foraging behaviours for targeting Chinook salmon. The specificity of these behaviours may make the whales less effective at capturing other types of fish. If northern residents have limited flexibility to modify their foraging behaviour to successfully exploit other prey types when Chinook availability is reduced, prey capture efficiency (and thus per capita energy intake) could decline.},

  abstract      = {I explored the biological basis of variation in recruitment (age 3 abundance), growth and age-specific adult survival rate for the major populations [West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI), Strait of Georgia, Central Coast, North Coast and Haida Gwaii] of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) that inhabit British Columbian waters. The analyses were based on a synthesis of time series of empirical observations of herring population characteristics (egg deposition, age-specific abundance and size) and prey, competitor and predator biomass/abundance. Recruitment was not correlated among populations. Recruitment variability was explained for WCVI herring only, as a consequence of prey (the euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera) biomass during August in each of the first 3 years of life, and the biomass of piscivorous Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) during the first year of life. Recruit mass and adult mass-at-age were correlated among populations and over ages within populations. Recruit mass was affected by T. spinifera biomass in August of the first and third years of life. Adult mass-at-age variability was determined mainly by size at the beginning of the growth season, but also by T. spinifera biomass in August. Age-specific adult survival rates were not correlated among the five populations. Survival rates decreased with age; there were additional population-specific effects of somatic mass and T. spinifera biomass in August. The analyses were repeated using physical oceanographic explanatory variables. Only recruit mass variation was explained significantly by physical oceanographic variables, and the biological-based explanation of recruit mass variability accounted for more of the variation.},

  abstract    = {Herring stock abundance in British Columbia waters is assessed using an age structured assessment model for the major stock assessment regions and an escapement model for the minor stocks in Areas 2W and 27. These models have been applied to assess herring abundance since 1984. Accurate estimates of current and future stock abundance rely heavily on consistent and reliable biological sampling of the populations. Extensive SCUBA surveys are conducted throughout the British Columbia coast to enumerate the numbers of fish spawning in each area and this information forms an important part of the data for determining total abundance in the age-structured model. Additional data on total harvest, fish size and age structure of the spawning runs are used to determine current abundance levels. As in recent assessments a fixed spawn conversion or catchability factor is applied for the dive survey era beginning in 1988 and a free fitted parameter is estimated for the earlier surface survey period. In addition, a year specific logistic function is applied to model the availability of fish on the spawning grounds. Forecasts of future stock abundance are developed from estimates of historical recruitment and used to provide advice on allowable harvest. The harvesting policy permits a maximum of up to 20% removal of the forecast spawning biomass provided the abundance is greater than the fishing threshold or Cutoff level established to conserve biomass in periods of reduced productivity.},

  abstract = {The history of Pacific herring egg deposition surveys in British Columbia is reviewed. Variability in components of the SCUBA egg deposition survey methodology used to assess the spawning biomass of herring stocks was evaluated by bootstrap simulations, thus providing confidence interval estimates for mean egg density, total area of deposition, and spawning-stock biomass. Variability in estimated spawning-stock biomass was larger than expected from variation in egg density alone. Bias was evident in the mean egg density estimated by a visual assessment model, apparently due to inter-diver variation in estimating model variables. Optimal sampling designs are robust and remain within current capabilities for sample collection. Alternative sampling approaches should be investigated to improve the accuracy of egg density and consequently spawning biomass estimates. Egg loss from spawning beds during the incubation period appears to be significant and may bias abundance estimates if assessment surveys occur late in the incubation period, Additional investigation will be required to develop coastwide adjustment factors. Aspects of the variability associated with surface spawn surveys are also discussed briefly.},
