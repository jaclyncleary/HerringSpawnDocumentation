  abstract    = {Herring stock abundance in British Columbia waters is assessed using an age structured assessment model for the major stock assessment regions and an escapement model for the minor stocks in Areas 2W and 27. These models have been applied to assess herring abundance since 1984. Accurate estimates of current and future stock abundance rely heavily on consistent and reliable biological sampling of the populations. Extensive SCUBA surveys are conducted throughout the British Columbia coast to enumerate the numbers of fish spawning in each area and this information forms an important part of the data for determining total abundance in the age-structured model. Additional data on total harvest, fish size and age structure of the spawning runs are used to determine current abundance levels. As in recent assessments a fixed spawn conversion or catchability factor is applied for the dive survey era beginning in 1988 and a free fitted parameter is estimated for the earlier surface survey period. In addition, a year specific logistic function is applied to model the availability of fish on the spawning grounds. Forecasts of future stock abundance are developed from estimates of historical recruitment and used to provide advice on allowable harvest. The harvesting policy permits a maximum of up to 20% removal of the forecast spawning biomass provided the abundance is greater than the fishing threshold or Cutoff level established to conserve biomass in periods of reduced productivity.},

  abstract = {The history of Pacific herring egg deposition surveys in British Columbia is reviewed. Variability in components of the SCUBA egg deposition survey methodology used to assess the spawning biomass of herring stocks was evaluated by bootstrap simulations, thus providing confidence interval estimates for mean egg density, total area of deposition, and spawning-stock biomass. Variability in estimated spawning-stock biomass was larger than expected from variation in egg density alone. Bias was evident in the mean egg density estimated by a visual assessment model, apparently due to inter-diver variation in estimating model variables. Optimal sampling designs are robust and remain within current capabilities for sample collection. Alternative sampling approaches should be investigated to improve the accuracy of egg density and consequently spawning biomass estimates. Egg loss from spawning beds during the incubation period appears to be significant and may bias abundance estimates if assessment surveys occur late in the incubation period, Additional investigation will be required to develop coastwide adjustment factors. Aspects of the variability associated with surface spawn surveys are also discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {Records of the date, location, and magnitude of Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) spawnings in British Columbia, collected since 1928, were compiled and analysed. In the early years of spawn surveys, adjacent spawnings were often reported as single events. Gradually, this practice has changed so that each spawning has a separate record. As a consequence of this change in methods, the mean length of spawnings has decreased in recent years but the total numbers of records has increased. Estimates of mean spawning width and intensity have also changed, partly due to changing survey methods as well as changing spawning distributions. A spawn abundance index is developed to account for these temporal changes. Abiotic factors affecting the distribution and abundance of spawn deposition include sea surface temperatures and the fishery. Biological factors affecting spawn distribution and abundance are not as well defined, but it is shown that in some situations, spawn dimensions may change as a function of stock abundance.},

  abstract  = {Approximately 3â€‚mo before spawning, Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) were captured and transferred to experimental netpens varying in fish density, cover, and feeding regimes. Fecundity decreased as the fish ripened. Concurrently, ovary weight and egg weight increased and somatic weight decreased. Length-specific fecundities of fed and unfed fish were similar, but the unfed fish had higher weight-specific fecundities, corresponding to a greater loss of somatic tissue during impoundment. Feeding accelerated the rate of maturity, and fed fish spawned earlier with heavier eggs than unfed fish. Relative fecundity (eggs per gram) was highest among the unfed fish. Reduction in preovulatory egg number probably was a consequence of follicular atresia (observed but not quantified here). Age-, length-, and weight-specific fecundity of impounded herring varied within the range observed for naturally maturing populations (1974 and 1980). Fecundity in impounded fish varied no more than observed in nature: there was a greater difference in age-, length-, and weight-specific fecundity between years than there was between experimental treatments. We suggest that reduction in the number of maturing oocytes occurs naturally and reflects a mechanism that allows herring to adjust their egg size and egg number according to energetic resources and environmental conditions.},
