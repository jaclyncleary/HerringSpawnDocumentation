This report documents the calculations used to convert spawn survey observations (e.g., number of egg layers, extent of spawn) to the spawn index for Pacific herring ($Clupea$ $pallasii$) in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
There are three types of spawn survey observations: surface observations, underwater observations of spawn on Macrocystis, and underwater observations of spawn on understory.
Data from these three survey types are combined to develop an overall annual spawn index for each stock assessment region in BC.
The spawn index is one component of Pacific herring stock assessments in BC.
Note that the 'spawn index' is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter, $q$ and therefore is not an estimate of spawning stock biomass.
