Get better kerning between multi-letter variable names. For example, variable names should go in a function rather than, say, $text$. Make a new function:
\newcommand{\mli}[1]{\mathit{#1}}  % or, use \textit{} which preserves spaces, and other things
where \mli stands for 'multi-letter identifier', and then put variable names as follows:
$\mli{P}=\mli{NP}$
