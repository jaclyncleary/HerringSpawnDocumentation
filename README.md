# Documentation for the Pacific herring spawn index in BC

This report documents the calculations used to convert spawn survey observations (e.g., number of egg layers, extent of spawn) to the spawn index for Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*) in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
There are three types of spawn survey observations: surface observations, underwater observations of spawn on Macrocystis, and underwater observations of spawn on understory.
Data from these three survey types are combined to develop an overall annual spawn index for each stock assessment region in BC.
Note that the `spawn index' is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter, $q$ and therefore is not an estimate of spawning stock biomass.
The spawn index is one component of Pacific herring stock assessments in BC.

This report is formatted to comply with the requirements for the series "Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences."
