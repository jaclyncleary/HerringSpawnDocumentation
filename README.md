# Documentation for the Pacific herring spawn index in BC

This report documents the calculations used to convert spawn survey observations (e.g., number of egg layers, extent, substrate) to the spawn index for Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*) in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
There are three types of spawn survey observations: surface observations, underwater observations of spawn on Macrocystis, and underwater observations of spawn on understory.
First, we calculate the spawn index for each of these three survey types separately.
Then we combine the three indices to determine the total spawn index.
Finally, we aggregate the total spawn index by year and stock assessment region, which is the temporal and spatial scale for Pacific herring science advice and fishery management in BC.
For example, the spawn index is one component of Pacific herring stock assessments in BC.
Note that the 'spawn index' is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter, *q* and therefore is not an estimate of spawning stock biomass.

This report is formatted to comply with the requirements for the series "Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences."
